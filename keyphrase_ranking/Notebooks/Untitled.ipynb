      "Okay, I will pay you when you mean so two key phrases would be grouped if they share a lot more entities than I mean just by count, right?\n",
      "The next thing is since we have those connections of nouns two key phrases to entities.\n",
      "So like I said introduced that it has Concepts, so if you have multiple now and say containers and then you have another one say containerization.\n",
      "Yeah, so they will eventually be tagged to entities like dog.\n",
      "Yeah, and then we can prune again over there based on how important our concept is for us since we have the importance of the entity in the global.\n",
      "So in that in that way we were forming these individual Concepts.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Right now is what if you have important key phrases that are not there in the knowledge base itself.\n",
      "So you have few sentences from which you can pick the candidate key phrases?\n",
      "So basically for Docker you have multiple key phrases that related to talk like yeah deploy the container from the container.\n",
      "So if you really have not seen even a single noun token from the key phrase in the knowledge base what we know for sure is that that something new and it is not associated with any known entity which means that in the in the in the next update which means for the next call it will carry it like you make some weight for now.\n",

So the so and next level at each group level you have this sentences can also be scored like the way you said hierarchy of scoring. Within the sentence, you know, what are the key phrases that are important? Which means that yes go now reverse it key phrases scoring is based on the sentence coding and sentence powering could be based on the audio call segment scoring with respect to the group. Yeah. So all this information is something that might help but at the same time it could also be over will be so you our idea was that we should wish I mean my thought process was that you should be able to lay down all the Explicitly laid on all the candidates that can help you to rank and then you pick 10 not everything would be helpful, right?

So that's why we didn't want to body call do anything about that, right? Yeah, so So I mean from the flow perspective, right? What we should probably also consider is you know, just think of it like a hierarchy. Okay, so groups are right as in the current flow groups are currently ranked based on their relevance to the semantic their relevance. And then you have this summer he's right. So the so and next level at each group level you have this sentences can also be scored like the way you said hierarchy of scoring. Within the sentence, you know, what are the key phrases that are important? Which means that yes go now reverse it key phrases scoring is based on the sentence coding and sentence powering could be based on the audio call segment scoring with respect to the group. Yeah. So all this information is something that might help but at the same time it could also be over will be so you our idea was that we should wish I mean my thought process was that you should be able to lay down all the Explicitly laid on all the candidates that can help you to rank and then you pick 10 not everything would be helpful, right? You should be able to pick what is organizations full from the approach that you mentioned and then and then discard everything else.

Not very aggressively we should have a better key phrases and then the number in that aspect that the number of key phrases which means after these all is qualitative filters should eventually lead right the ranking also, right? Yeah. So after all this filtrations that you just mentioned if you have a set of key phrases, which means that they have qualified on a on a very semantic level as well as the frequency level right here.

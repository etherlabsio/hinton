What we should probably also consider is you know, just think of it like a hierarchy. Okay, so groups are right as in the current flow groups are currently ranked based on their relevance to the semantic their relevance. And then you have this summer he's right. So the so and next level at each group level you have this sentences can also be scored like the way you said hierarchy of scoring. Within the sentence, you know, what are the key phrases that are important? Which means that yes go now reverse it key phrases scoring is based on the sentence coding and sentence powering could be based on the audio call segment scoring with respect to the group. Yeah. So all this information is something that might help but at the same time it could also be over will be so you our idea was that we should wish I mean my thought process was that you should be able to lay down all the Explicitly laid on all the candidates that can help you to rank and then you pick 10 not everything would be helpful, right? You should be able to pick what is organizations full from the approach that you mentioned and then and then discard everything else. So actually that was the whole thought process of hierarchical importance is what we should consider not just the literal what you call literal feature vector or literal. ",

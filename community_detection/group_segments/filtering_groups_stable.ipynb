That is the that is the that is the reason why the model was not consistent with the other models.

      "And welcome back to work Daily and today is video I am going to give you eight smart questions ask hiring managers and job interviews, but before I do that I just wanna remind you it clicks the link below to subscribe about you get instant speech every time to be create nuclear content that helps you get a ahead. Alright so what do you do when you are in an interview and we get to that end where the hiring manager looks at you and said, give any questions for me all of course you do in fact it is very important you ask questions I wanna tell you the recently and a employer right now reached out to be frustrated and said I hate when I asked that question and the person says otherwise that he is been really nice. I think I am okay that person told me does mac get hired and the reason for that is that they have real confirmed. If you are not asking questions if you want doing your do generation and if you mart having enough value in yourself. It ask clarifying mind questions to make sure that this business is the right place for you remember we always tell you you are a working daily that you are business of want selling your services to an employer and you wanna make sure that it is a good partnership so to do that you have got ask questions to make sure that this is the right place for you. It is like kicking the tires are looking under the eyes make sure that you are making a good investment. So that mind let us take a look at the eight questions you should be asking me your next category. So before break down the eight questions been to tell you that they fall into four categories that we call them the four C is now by cutting up on these four C is you are gonna make sure that you are asking all of us is necessary to make a great decision about this employer and those four C is are connect and to culture validate and closely even by out knows that guys hiring that person he will be working with one action questions to help you bond in the interview as far as culture does you wanna make sure this is the right corporate culture for you does this company believe and have values and go about business in the way that you respect trust that you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Best, but forward with respect challenges you wanna know what is keeping them up at night so that you can make sure these these are the kinds of challenges that you actually Wanna work on and leverage your skills to be successful flag and then lastly close you want to end this interviews conversation on a high. Note you wanna leave very clear and what the next step are so once we know the four C is it gets really easy to create questions. So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we are getting the information we need and that is what I am gonna show you next. So we are starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side. So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they are like as a worker. So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer. This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company. Whilst you are gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you would really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company is stupid for you. So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not. It is a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company. The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role. This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully. I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that is something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they are recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The right place for you and the second place you wanna ask is the polar opposite. Tell me about a hire recently that did not work out why did they fail them another role once again you want listen closely to the answer because we want to see if the traits are characteristics of that person who failed sound like yourself you do not think you can be successful there at the person it sounds like they really could not have a one in their job and you are gonna know that this is the right place for you and the thirteenth is challenge units and specifically the challenges of the company is going to get facing in the coming year. So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it. There is is showing that that you understand you are a business of one your service provider and that what you are going to do is help them solve a about and alleviate your team. So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you are really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I am having a positive impact on this challenge. Once again you are taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I am supposed to do that you are sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that is a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there is no real way to measure we will not have any idea whether or not you are making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you are gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company cannot measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably do not want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you are talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that is how to properly close up this conversation. So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I tell you it really works is if there were some skills or experience which I had that would make me a benefit fit for this job. What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview. This is a chance for them to call out and explain any certain skills or experience or things that might make uncertainty and high on you and so asking this question shows that you understand you are not a perfect candidate but then you do wanna to know what you can done better by the same and token if they do share something with you you now have an opportunity to say oh but I did not share this experience or maybe I need to tell you about this feels that I ask it is a chance for me to but become that objection maybe be realizing that you can give them everything they needed to to hear space. That is a really important question ask and that last question is what are the next steps in the process and that is you want to understand where you stand and what has to happen next beauty get hired you do not ever wanna leave a job wondering when you will get a phone call and they will follow up when they will make their decision. So ask this question is gonna help you get that information they are likely gonna tell you some things like while everything more people interview they will hear by this date you need to come back in for another interview, but at least you will have that information you will not be staring at the fathers or staring at your email has wondering whether or not you got the job you have the great thing about that is that if they give you a data that and it comes and goes you now have a valid reasons follow up with them and say when we spoke to the interview you mentioned and this will be the next steps that base come and gone is there anything else I can refer that my candidacy say so this is a really important question for you to ask for your own piece of mind at the same time it is going give you a sense of how structure this company is really how well got out their own hiring offices so that you can get a clear sense of whether or not they are the kind of company you wanna work there you how then the four C is connect culture challenges and clothes and with two questions of teams creates a super smart questions you should be asking hiring managers in your next job interview. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can hear I want hear from you if there one particular question you have asked in an interview that got a great resolved or maybe uses a question you apps that didnt get a good result make sure you share it with me below you want your you okay so questions not in feedback regarding this video we just to make sure you post it below we answer each everyone and I also hope that you will share and like this content because you know there is a lot of people out there that need help care questions, you will be doing that in a favor and I will make you as good as well lastly do not forget to subscribe each every week we are bringing to fresh new career content that help you get ahead and most of importantly I cannot wait to see you in the next video so with in mind remember this if you wanna win you have got work it daily. \n",

So I am gonna have the show a lot of detailed concepts and kubernetes, but I want give you a rough idea what is it and let us actually do and what is responsible for so there is a few different architectural components too, which I am gonna talk about the first of which is the kubernetes cluster services and the fundamental from behind kubernetes is that we can enforce what is called desired state manager. \n",

The second building block of the system is this thing called day worker and what is a worker? Well, the worker is really just a container host the one thing unique about a worker or the container host in a nineties environment. It does have this equivalent process that runs, which is responsible for communicating with yes, you guessed kubernetes cluster services and so this whole thing the cluster services. The workers themselves that is what makes up is oracle cost. So in this case you what we wanna do is wanna feed this the configuration. So the desired snake service to speak exists here in a deployment yellow file. So here I am just gonna call an application one dot. \n",

Maybe I want to have to container images and further demo line. There is other things like what people board and we are services right or what that, but another additional thing is that I am gonna specify how many of these pods you could be running here. So maybe there is three more number that I can also list additional box of your flaws. So pod number two yeah, I basically have container image number three and then replicas as a configuration file equal to two. I will take this deployment file and will be it to the API with up you will be up to the cluster service figure out how to schedule the pods in the environment and make sure that I have the right number of pods. So I see this file up here let us work on pod one so I am gonna have pod one replica one pod one replica two pod one replica three in addition I have also got pod. So here we are pod to replica one and in this case we have two replica here. So let us just do pod one replica to here and so you can see at any point in time the cluster services a responsibility to make sure that configuration is running across all of my computer code groups. \n",

      " And welcome back to work Daily and today is video I am going to give you eight smart questions ask hiring managers and job interviews, but before I do that I just wanna remind you it clicks the link below to subscribe about you get instant speech every time to be create nuclear content that helps you get a ahead. Alright so what do you do when you are in an interview and we get to that end where the hiring manager looks at you and said, give any questions for me all of course you do in fact it is very important you ask questions I wanna tell you the recently and a employer right now reached out to be frustrated and said I hate when I asked that question and the person says otherwise that he is been really nice. I think I am okay that person told me does mac get hired and the reason for that is that they have real confirmed. If you are not asking questions if you want doing your do generation and if you mart having enough value in yourself. It ask clarifying mind questions to make sure that this business is the right place for you remember we always tell you you are a working daily that you are business of want selling your services to an employer and you wanna make sure that it is a good partnership so to do that you have got ask questions to make sure that this is the right place for you. It is like kicking the tires are looking under the eyes make sure that you are making a good investment. So that mind let us take a look at the eight questions you should be asking me your next category. So before break down the eight questions been to tell you that they fall into four categories that we call them the four C is now by cutting up on these four C is you are gonna make sure that you are asking all of us is necessary to make a great decision about this employer and those four C is are connect and to culture validate and closely even by out knows that guys hiring that person he will be working with one action questions to help you bond in the interview as far as culture does you wanna make sure this is the right corporate culture for you does this company believe and have values and go about business in the way that you respect trust that you. \n",

Note you wanna leave very clear and what the next step are so once we know the four C is it gets really easy to create questions. So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we are getting the information we need and that is what I am gonna show you next. So we are starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side. So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they are like as a worker. So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer. This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company. Whilst you are gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you would really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company is stupid for you. So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not. It is a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company. The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role. This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully. I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that is something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they are recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this. \n",

      " The right place for you and the second place you wanna ask is the polar opposite. Tell me about a hire recently that did not work out why did they fail them another role once again you want listen closely to the answer because we want to see if the traits are characteristics of that person who failed sound like yourself you do not think you can be successful there at the person it sounds like they really could not have a one in their job and you are gonna know that this is the right place for you and the thirteenth is challenge units and specifically the challenges of the company is going to get facing in the coming year. So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it. There is is showing that that you understand you are a business of one your service provider and that what you are going to do is help them solve a about and alleviate your team. So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you are really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I am having a positive impact on this challenge. Once again you are taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I am supposed to do that you are sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that is a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there is no real way to measure we will not have any idea whether or not you are making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you are gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company cannot measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably do not want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you are talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that is how to properly close up this conversation. So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great. \n",

      " But I tell you it really works is if there were some skills or experience which I had that would make me a benefit fit for this job. What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview.

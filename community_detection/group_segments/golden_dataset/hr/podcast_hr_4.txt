However, a recent Harvard Business review article suggests an employee engagement is bad for employers because highly engaged employees are wedded to the status quo and won't sink to change it. How do you respond to that? Yes, I'm familiar with that article. But I feel that perhaps there was a commingling of the two distinct terms Employee Engagement versus employee satisfaction. So for me, like Employee Engagement is not the same as employee satisfaction while an Engaged employee are satisfied with their jobs satisfied employees are not necessarily engaged. So I see why the hrb of HDR suggested what it did but I think it's kind of confusing they're confusing two things. If I was to just directly look at the way or any access really would look at it satisfaction with measured but it's not any longer than metric of success employees may be satisfied, but they're still looking for jobs. And why is that and and we really think that it's because they're not activated. Do you remember the old Mantra? Well, maybe not that Old company is as good as its employees or employees are your greatest asset of ever those terms. I'm sure you have sure. Yeah. Well, it's now employees are your only asset so there are real incentive to invest employees as the returns are greater than the employee commitment. It gives those returns are greater rather unemployed commitment motivation productivity and ultimately profit and mean in some Cases and I think we forget. ",

Sure. So making employees feel important, you know Executives know what they do what they do matters and that knowledge comes with the position their decisions really can have a dramatic and sometimes obvious effect on the company. We all we have all seen that right when you know that what you do carries that kind of weight and importance than your naturally more engaged in your role. So while knowing the stakes is a given for For other employees is maybe three or four layers removed from those Executives. The stakes are not so clear or may not be so clear. And that is precisely the problem study after study has shown that for employees to feel engage. They need to know that what they do is important. They're just not coming to work, you know every day in completing tasks and then leaving to that day the things that they do every day are moving the needle working towards some goal or another but perhaps in a less obvious way than than the doings of those at the top but every employees contribution impacts the company and if that is not already being communicated it really needs to be ",

So the second lesson goes hand-in-hand with the first not only do executive know their job is important, but they have a transparent view of the company. It allows them to see directly how the things that they're doing are affecting the performance. So so this kind of transparency at all levels of an organization. It really could increase engagement and might not be possible or even smart to open the book to all employees. But luckily you don't have to do that in order to bring more about more transparency to be honest with employees about their hard work and on a quarterly basis, it allows them to join the conversation and showing where your business Is where it wants to go and how those employees can help one get there. So by proactively providing employees with information about their specific impact on the company, whether it's dashboard team meetings one-on-one Town Halls Etc. I mean, I think it's really less employees knows that the nothing of importance is being kept from them and how important they are to your team and to the organization while employees don't really need that corner office treat. Any employees like Executives in their roles can go a long way in improving engagement and activation strategy in the future. Okay, good now I'd like to talk a little bit about measurement the survey in fact uncovered the fact that 34 percent said they measure engagement or activation but why is it important to do that measurement? How do you do that measurement? And how do you Benchmark your engagement and activation over time? Yeah, I don't think one can afford. ",

They can use turnover rates and comparing those two engagement scores to they can use business indicators such as as employee productivity performance company revenue does to demonstrate engagement or activation or lack thereof. Another item would be show outside case studies as proof that Employee Engagement programs are effective in a wide range of companies and are not just hype and then lastly ensure there's a constant review of the three-pronged approach communication education and results. There's also I'm sorry. I also forgot to other things that I wanted to say here though. I think it's important to show executive the results of employee feedbacks like from surveys or focus groups or other forms of measurement measuring engagement, but lastly actively involved the executive team and decisions about Employee Engagement programs. That's probably one of the best things to do. Okay, great. Thank you.

Nobody gets what they want, you know, it's like I said confusing all around and it's very indirect and it can come off as sneaky.

But regardless we can fall into these traps. One thing we don't want to do is assume that you understand what the other person is feeling. Being you've probably been in that situation yourself, maybe had something happen in your personal life and your feeling really stressed anxious or depressed and somebody says I know exactly how you feel. Oftentimes when someone says that even though they mean well, it comes across as kind of all-knowing or even the opposite of there's no way you could possibly know how I feel and that can put us on the defense. And it's very easy to make someone feel defensive and want to shut down if we engage in preaching interrogating threatening and critical communication. Another trap that's easy to fall into is saying, you know, me too and again, it comes from a good place, but it can end up making someone feel more isolated and less willing to communicate with you. Avoiding in our communication style can lead to bitterness and resentment which can lead to sarcasm. ",

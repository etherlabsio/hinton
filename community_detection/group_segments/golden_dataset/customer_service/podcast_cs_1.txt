I think this actually this question has been growing a lot more as of late, you know in the traditional sense. Everybody has a cell phone. We all think that voice is is not a singular tool, you know Voice and text go hand-in-hand together when we first created are call about three four years ago. We really wanted to make sure that That voice part of it is as clear and concise and as effective as possible. So through our own product. We do not offer text messaging but we do integrate the through our open API with a multitude of other services and platforms some of them being SMS. So we really are able to kind of create that seamless conversation with are call with another SMS platform and even gorgeous to kind of create that entire full picture. You the conversation so to recap no, we do not offer in our product, but we absolutely can have that as a functionality with other products guys. So yeah, I know that followed up with most of a kind of cosmic college students and they prefer text. So since you mentioned like the integration with Gorgeous Kara was asking about that as well, and she she said she did she miss the view the slides where you showed the air column gorgeous interface. If you could go back to that she like to see it again. Then yeah, absolutely. If you guys can see that there. ",

I think this is the hardest one right? I'm sure we all have some similar traits on our wish list of what of customer characteristics and I believe me. I wish I could control that but we don't have to wait around for these mythical magical customers to appear we can to some extent. Push them to better themselves and to create them ourselves. Yeah, we wish that the customers were like perfect and they just come and you know exactly what they needed when shopped got it and left without asking any questions, but in reality doesn't doesn't work that way and the reason it doesn't work that way probably because you don't answer those questions in advance. Right? Right. I mean that would be the dream right to be able to know exactly what they wanted or not even not even calling it that because they already know what they they want and they can get the answer by themselves. So part of the trick is to keep your marketing and your sales team accountable is my first one first and foremost you want to be sure that they aren't positive promising something that your business can't deliver and I think this is one of the biggest pain points for customer success customer relations customer support, you know is making sure that you're held accountable and your whole entire company and your team is held accountable for the product that you're showing your customers because at the end of the day customer's always right. Beyond that you should also be helping customers make better decisions. So discuss the differences between products tears and packages and show how real customers are actually using it. So recommend other complementary products if need be a great example of this is the bellroy wallet example, so they give a visual explanation of what fits inside of the wallet. So right off the bat, you know, and the customer knows what they're going to be getting with this. ",

So biggest things I would be if you're using our call that would be a great opportunity there if you have the opportunity within the voice Channel To create some type of Q again to allow that time frame between customer conversations to be spread out a little bit more for your agents as well as working again smarter not harder in pods. You can kind of create escalation pods. You can create, you know certain time frames with where certain agents are working and then they'll take a break for an hour. And then those Agents come back again. So again, it can get Taylor's to every individual team and Company. But really definitely thinking about like, you know what your what's it? What would be good for your agents? Essentially? Mmm. Another thing to add is it, you know, you mentioned this in the talk just like going back and seeing what are the questions that people ask, you know in the email and the support in the on phone calls. And if you find that people are asking certain questions very often like you know, what is your shipping policy or return policy then maybe that is something you service on the website so that it's there in front of them and they don't have to ask you. That anymore so that it cuts down on the number of incoming queries like through the phone or through email. Yep. Yep. And that's the whole point about you know, kind of using the technology that you do have to to really be smarter about the way that you're handling those conversations. So, yeah, so maybe something a good takeaway for everyone watching this right now is to go back, you know, look through those previous conversations, you've had with customers see if there are any patterns emerging any very frequently asked questions and throw that up on the surf on the website kind of like ",

We want to handle quantity but also with quality there and as you can see from this slide most companies still aren't satisfied with the standard with any kind of consistency, you know, even though the focus is to really Empower your team with a better conversation at the beginning. It's still really hard to paint that full picture of the customer how many times they've called in what their recent interactions have been like so there really is a massive opportunity. T to rise above the competition but also above the standards for your own team. If you can person that experience just even like a little bit. So this is what companies like gorgeous and are call are kind of designed to help you do it a little bit easier than maybe previously so we are trying to push all of the contacts in history of a customer's conversation into one single actionable view. So instead of forcing customers. Restart the story from chapter 1 every time that they call in or they chat in you can actually resume their conversation where the last time that they left off, you know, so let's say the the chat they left the chat early, you know, we want to pick up at the end of that chat. So they were talking about an order that they had just placed. Well, we don't want to have to restart that conversation and say oh, what's your name again? What order did you place what your order number? We want to hop right back into to say oh, you know, this is the last time that we we had a conversation is this where where we want to talk about again, you know, if you're curious what this might look like in your own environment stay tuned later, and we're going to offer a special promotion on that. But if you absolutely can't make any changes this year, which is quite difficult because we're so close to the Black Friday season. There's still probably a ton of like low-tech workarounds then at that can still help make more of the right customer data accessible. ",

I'm standing up here saying, you know, I'm really glad that the Vermont tourism Network had asked me to do this Workshop pleased to be here with you this afternoon. And do you believe me and it did I say anything different? I mean verbally I told you I was glad to be here but my Body language was screaming. Mmm, not so much. So we have to be very careful that yes, we can look really good. But body language wise are we doing what we need to do to line up our vision our mission and what we're telling all these great people cross the the social media Network. Come come stay with us because we're great but we've got to take care of this as well. So what we do there's a lot to the body language aspect and we're pretty much aware of it, but it's bringing it to the conscious level being able to be aware of it.

They have our customers Bill of Rights printed right on the bag. Now you talk about commitment saying, you know, we're we're so committed to this that will even put it in writing so that you get because they well you said it you said it right here. Yeah, that's right on the bag. So to me that that shows commitment and it's a value because I know that if you know, they're that committed that I know that I'll get great service.

Alice when we were down there and there was a scraper in the car in Dallas and I said, what do you need a great windshield scraper for what? We got up the next morning. There was frost on the window. I said, well that's why is that but if we hadn't had it then I don't know what we would have done. So it's exceeding the expectations.

I'm going to be 70 years old and if I don't do that airplane ride, I ain't never gonna go. So they started back and forth and back and forth arguing about this $10 actually be 24. The two of them. Finally the pilot said tell you what I'll take you up on that airplane ride for nothing, but I don't want to hear a word from either one of you so Martha said, let's go Stumpy. It's a good deal. So they loaded into the plane and the pilot and his mind is saying I'm going to have fun with this one. He takes off and he goes straight up in the air straight down flips over. Looks back not a word not a sound not a word. So he says well do it again goes straight up straight down flips over flips back nothing. So he lands the plane and he said I got to tell you I just took you on the wildest airplane ride I've ever given anybody somebody says well, I was going to say something when Martha fell out but $10 is $10. Now, what's that got to do with customers? Service. Well, we do want to give them an experience but we want to hang on to them and we want to create that loyalty. So they'll come back for the next ride just by a show of hands how many innkeeper's or lodging representation. Do we have? Okay restaurants a lodging restaurants. ",

Time and to focus it really does set us head and shoulders above others to take that time to listen now. I will tell you this though on the other side. I had a guest in my store. It was after I first opened maybe two or three months and it was around October. She came in she goes so Carrie, I don't like this time of year. And I said well and I really want to listen to her and I said well, what's wrong Mary and she said, I don't know. I don't like I just don't like this time of year.

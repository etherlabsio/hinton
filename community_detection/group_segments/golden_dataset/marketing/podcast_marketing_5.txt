It's just I want to get the very best deal as a customer. I want to get the highest quality for the lowest price. You tell me why I should buy from you why you are giving me the highest quality the lowest price and if your answer is better than that of your competitors, I'll buy from you and if it's not I won't and it's not personal no. Emotion involved we get emotionally involved because it's our business. So differentiation is the key is how and why and where are you different segmentation means looking at your market and saying who are the specific customers in the market who value my area of differentiation and who will pay more for my area of specialization and anybody else. So in other words in every Marketplace and they say that all market now all marketing today is segmentation is segmenting and identifying Those customers who are most likely to buy from you the fastest and finally there's concentration. Once you have determined your very best market segments for what you do really? Well what you do is you focus all your energies on them. So let's look at these specialization says this is the product service customer Market or area of Technology where you focus all your efforts. We also say in specialization. It can be a product or service. It can be a particular customer that you want to serve or it. And be a particular market area that you want to work in. I'll give you an example McDonald's McDonald's customer is people who want to eat quickly and they want cleanliness efficiency value price and pleasant surroundings. And so what they will do is they will offer every product that they possibly can for people who want to eat quickly whether it's a salad or whether it's a shake or whether it's a type of coffee or whether it's in other words. They're constantly looking for other products that they can offer to that customer. ",

They brought antitrust suits against IBM just like they tried to break up Microsoft. They finally Reagan came into power. They started in 1970 and 1983. Bright was brought to Reagan's attention. They said the federal government has been pursuing IBM in 50 million hundred million dollar lawsuits for 13 years. And what do they come up with people by IBM? Because they really like IBM and IBM treats him really? Well they said well if they can't come up with something on IBM have to drop the lawsuit and they said we can't come up with anything that the customer need antitrust is supposed to be in favor of protecting customers IBM's customers. Love them worldwide. Then drop the suit, they dropped the suit after 13 years. They did the same thing with Microsoft. They harass them and harass them in her master because they weren't getting enough political contributions. That was the major reason. They weren't getting enough political contributions. Finally after years of had to say, why do people buy Microsoft because they like the product the product is good and it's cheap and it's flexible and everything. So so so here's so how would you describe your perfect customer? This point? I was making with IBM is IBM realized that when they first started Selling the 360 Mainframe in 1964. The customer was really the president of the company making a major strategic decision. Are we going to put everything in our company on computers? Because everything was paper at that time, you know and so they would have to make their presentations to the senior Executives of the company and work out all the numbers and so on but as computers became more and more popular and they start to have PCS and desktops and so on the whole decision-making shifted to the purchasing manager of the large companies and so they had to focus and change all ",

In other words, you can't sit there and plan military strategy ignoring who your enemy is and where they are and how big they are and what their plans and intentions are. So no strategy and business can be made without thinking about your competition and who are they and what do they do? And why do people buy from them and how can I get them to buy from me? And how will they react if I get their customers? There's volumes of books in the libraries on this and I've got them all there's one book called competitive analysis. Is this bait by Michael? Order so a six eight hundred pages and it's all on things that you have to think about to position against competition big stuff. You can get phds in marketing focused on competitive analysis.

You have only one word unique. Each person here is unique. You are not unique ER you are not the unicast you are unique because only one of you in the entire world. So therefore what is your unique selling proposition? I have worked with people as spent hours. Identify this and when I finally identified it their business went up five hundred percent in the next 12 months that could not believe it. They went from struggling to live in a big home driving a Cadillac or a Mercedes because they finally found it and then all of your advertising all of your promotion, all of your work is focused on conveying that USP to your customers getting it to them so that they are clear what it is and if it's what customers want and value and will pay for they will line up around the street remember when they brought up the iPad.

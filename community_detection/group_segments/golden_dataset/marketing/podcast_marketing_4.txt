Lee Klaus is a thriller novel. It is a mountain lion version of Jaws which came out of my living in Arizona for about four or five years back earlier in this decade. I initially wrote the novel in 2004 took about six months to write took about six months to revise and in January of 2005. I sent out 70 to query letters or 74 query. In January and March of 2005 to literary agents of those 74 agents that I queried. I got one agent who was extremely interested in the book and put me under contract that agent shot the novel around to the best publishing houses in New York City. Simon & Schuster Warner books harpercollins Random House penguin Putnam. And we got a lot of feedback from a lot of major editors in the business Dan Brown's editor hardcover editor Jason Kaufman as well as his paperback editor Emily Besler gave me some feedback on the novel through my agent But ultimately everybody declined on the book and that led sadly to the dissolution of my contract with my agent, which is a scenario, which actually is not that uncommon.

You don't need 500 endorsements. You don't need 250 endorsements really just a handful of them, maybe 10 or less is all you need now I got to so. Far then they were from pretty well-known authors folks that I've gotten to know over the past couple of years and they wrote really glowing witty interesting endorsements for the book. But I actually queried about 15 Riders. Now, these are folks that I know and have gotten to know. So I guess the moral of the story is, you know cast your net wide and get endorsements the next step after I got endorsements for the book from a couple of pretty well established authors. Was to plan out how I was going to actually tour for the book. I don't have a ton of money and you might find yourself in the exact same situation. So what do you do to actually promote the novel? Well in 2009, what I decided to do was do a Blog tour and what that is is essentially what you're watching right this moment. What a Blog tour is is my visiting various sites for a set number of days and on a given day when I'm visiting a site like today. I'm visiting publishing cell.com. I go to the site with a prepared a video or text message and talk about some aspect of publishing or my book for me. What I decided to do is set up a 45-day blocked or I had seen people.

Of course as you're watching this video you're watching this on YouTube. And so that's another marketing strategy that I've decided to use is using online video. My belief in the online video is nothing sells better than the person himself and nothing represents the person himself better than a video image of the sell of yourself. So I really believe in YouTube as being one of the most Credible sources for you know for the Guerrilla marketer out there if people see your face, you know, they know who you are, you know what you're about and so I really encourage you to consider using YouTube or Facebook or Twitter or any of these sites to really be proactive if there's an underlying message to all this it's be proactive speaking of YouTube. Another thing that I did to Market clause and other essential ingredient I think in Thousand and nine for anybody marketing a book is I created several different book trailers for my book Klaus. The book is essentially it's a mountain lion version of Jaws said in Arizona. Like I said, it's a thriller and so one of the things that I did in my book trailer or one of the book trailers that I that I did actually showed a man being mauled by a mountain lion for the first 10 or 15 seconds.

About a year ago and decided to to self-publish the novel first. I really did my homework because I had done a couple of other books prior to that and decided to go with create space.com rather than Lulu largely because create space was able to produce this book at a base price of three dollars and 58 cents per unit which H if you compare this exact same book to lose base price, which I did a comparison of by uploading the exact same file at Lulu retails for about $9 a little bit over $9 for a for one copy of the book compared to create spaces $3.58 per unit. And so I ended up going with create space. I clearly it was the better economical choice to go with and There I started marketing the book and thinking about how to market the book which is really the meat of what I want to talk to you guys about today and hopefully this will be interesting information for you.

And so I would encourage you to consider checking out YouTube or Some other online Source where you can post videos and come up with content that's interesting informative. Generally YouTube videos are best when they're short less than 30 seconds. No more than a minute unless you're providing content like what we're talking about right this moment, which has to be elaborated on a lot further.

Hopefully I'm not wearing you guys out but a couple of other things to consider doing as well.

Points for how to actually get up a Kindle version available. Another thing that I did was I made a paperback version available on Amazon at a really reasonable price the typical price for a trade paperback, which is a 6x9 book the typical price for major publisher who's doing a trade version is about $14 anywhere between 12 and 14 dollars for roughly the same size book. I have my version available on Amazon for a very reasonable $10.99. Another thing the point of that is another thing to consider in your marketing strategy in campaign for your book is a price point that is reasonable that is competitive with other similar titles. You know, you don't want to price point that's like 30 dollars for your book or nobody's going to buy it. You want to price point that's competitive with like titles. In in stores.

It's on the internet. So on each day during this blocked or what I'm doing is I'm visiting blogs that I have pre-arranged with the proprietor of the blog to discuss some aspects of publishing or marketing my book then cost a dime this costs nothing to do as I'm producing this specific video, which will air on publish and sell.com and a couple of days but as I'm producing this this is at the end of day. One and day one has been an absolute non-stop transaction of talking with writers and talking with readers about the book from the time. I got up this morning until now at 11:30 p.m. At night. So it's been a very busy day has been a very fun day and it's just the first day of the 45-day blocked or the cool thing about this is you don't have to get out on the road. You don't have to Burn fuel, you don't have to pay for gas or hotels or food or lodging.

                "originalText": "A couple of other things that I've done to Market Clause that might be helpful to here for the past couple of years. I've been doing a lot of author events at bookstores. I've been moderating panel discussions and inviting authors in who are better established in the and editors and agents to talk about the publishing process and over the course of the past couple of years. I've built up an email database of folks who have come to these events. At every event I do and this is something I suggest and recommend and encourage you to do as well at every event that I do I pass around a sign-in sheet for folks to write down their name and their email address on and this has grown for me over the past two years or so two or three years to almost 2,000 email addresses. For people who have come to events. They've seen me in action actually in bookstores or libraries and it has built a database of people. So what I did to start the day with today was I actually emailed all the folks in my database list to let them know that that Clause is for sale and not only of that. What I did was I said the first 10 people who respond to this email and promised to write a review at Amazon.com or on their blog or host before an interview on your blog or put something in your community newsletter about the book or me, or what have you the first 10 people to do that get a free copy or the first 10 people to respond to the email promising to do that. I would send them a free copy of Claus. I had 10 people respond like that within about 45 minutes. So it was immediate and it has not stopped all day as you can imagine with 2,000 email addresses in your database. I've had a lot of people say, you know II inside the top ",

I said in the email that I sent out anybody who buys five or more copies of Claws and I'll extend this offer to anybody watching this this video anybody who buys five or more copies of claws at amazon.com and can show me proof either by taking a photo of the five copies when they arrived and said, Ending me a JPEG image of the photo or descending me proof from Amazon.com or anything. If you buy five copies, I will interview you on my TV show on YouTube and in Raleigh, North Carolina, which airs on Time Warner Cable to 90 thousand homes in our area. So I made a deal and I've already had one person actually take me up and show me the proof that they bought the the actual five copies. I've had one other person say they're going to do it. So that was just something I kind of created as I was writing the email this morning. In fact, the point of all this is I suppose be proactive. It's really up to you as a writer to steer the course of your own career. And if you sit around and you don't do anything to promote your writing and promote your book nobody's going to find out about it particularly if you self-publish it or even more so if you self-publish But the truth is even if you publish with a major publisher or you self publish your book, you're going to have to find an interesting fun witty novel way to promote your book. So most people know this and I'm sure you probably do watching the video at home. I guess if there's a if there's a point to this it's finding a creative way or finding, you know, sort of out of the box weighs like a Blog tour to promote your novel. So that was the next major thing that I set up for four ",

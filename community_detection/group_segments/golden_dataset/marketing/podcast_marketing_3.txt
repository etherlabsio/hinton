We used hair color and eye color and eye shape and even makeup personality. There were millions of unique content combinations. No two guides were alike. Each customer had information just for them. It was technically very difficult. It was a huge achievement to be able to pull it off, but I didn't realize the power of what we created until I started reading the comments.

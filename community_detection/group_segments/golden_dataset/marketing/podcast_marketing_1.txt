So rather than just explaining how your clients can stage their home to sell faster. Maybe include a story about a past a past client who refuse to do that and then the house sat on the market for a long time until she finally gave in and did and then sold her house for $10,000 above asking price and make the story colorful when you can, you know include how you were feeling watching. Gene that will that happen and then how she felt when she finally sold her house? All right, next up. I want you to start incorporating video in 2019 and your emails and not only put video in your emails. But say so right in the subject line that's going to double your open rates. The other benefit is people are much more likely to actually consume your content and get the message. You're trying to send them in a video format versus reading plaintext and almost everybody is much more able to you know, understand. Retain that information when they're seeing it and hearing it in video just take whatever content and you're going to put in your email and just make a short video about it and it doesn't even have to be high production value that trips a lot of people up thinking they have to get a whole camera crew and spend hundreds of dollars on a video you 100% Don't just use your smartphone do a short selfie Style video. It'll connect just fine and you get your point across and finally just upload it to YouTube and get a little screen capture of the thumbnail of that. And put that image right in your email and then link it to the video itself. Alright next play the hits so so many small businesses get really intimidated when they start thinking about putting together an email campaign, but more times than not they already have content that they can repurpose and string together into an email series that they can just set it up once and then it gets automatically sent out to new email subscribers at the exact moment that they end up opting into it.

                "originalText": "Of both of those topics to all of those customers a lot of them might start unsubscribing right or you could have one overarching umbrella lead Magnet or freebie. And then with any that's kind of interesting to everyone and then when they're downloading it, you can't just have a simple option where they check which service or the most interested in and then your email provider like mulch MailChimp or I use drip. They would see what box they checked and that automatically puts. Them on either track a or track be alright next I want to talk about re-engaging or scrubbing your list. So it's really good to have a big list, you know quantity can be good. It's all the numbers game but it's more important to have a quality list that actually opens your emails and it is looking forward to hearing from you every week. So if you have a big list of people who really aren't ever opening your emails, you run a higher risk of your emails being flagged as spam or getting high unsubscribe rates and these Basically really bad signals to the email providers like Gmail and what happens is if you get enough people who were flagging your emails as spam or unsubscribing from your emails, they can start putting you out of the Inbox and into either the promotions tab or even worse you can wind up in the spam folder and that goes for your entire list. Not just the people who flagged as spam you have someone Flags you as spam. They'll they won't get your emails anymore. But all the people who even like hearing from you. You it's going to go in their spam folder as well. So you definitely don't want that to happen and the other advantage of having a leaner list of only the people who are most interested in hearing from you is cost. You know, most of these service providers, you know, MailChimp drift activecampaign all of them. They basically bill you based on how many subscribers you have. So it makes sense to you know weed out some of the ones who are just dead weight essentially, but before you start just kicking people out like a bouncer you might want to run a ",

                "originalText": "Preview today his Series starts today with a new helpful email every week until that series is over then when Meg ups and next April her cycle starts then getting the exact same email Series. So if you have some great blog posts already or a podcast interview you did or a video anything like that. That's all content that you can use. You just have to introduce it in the email and then link to it and if you don't have anything yet. That's okay just start writing one new email a week for as long as you think the series should go on for and then just put that email every time at the end of that campaign. So essentially you're just building this email campaign out at your own pace once and then it can go on and live on forever and I recommend kind of splitting up the content here and there, you know, maybe some blog posts some videos and some weeks you can even go a little easier on yourself and just put the information or the tips right in the body of the email itself. You could even leak out to content every once in a while that you had nothing to do with creating just put your own spin on it in the body of the Email letting people know why you think it's helpful for them and then just link out to it. Alright, the other thing that's working really well now is by using some simple segmentation. Let's say your business offers a few different types of services or has a few different types of products that interest different types of customers. Like if you're a landscaper, you might offer, you know, tree removal service landscape design and weekly lawn maintenance. If you could theoretically create three different lead magnets or freebies that are geared Each service, then you can start each person who hops in for the free be about Lawn Care on to that email sequence. So basically they would be on track a then when someone downloads the freebie all about, you know your options for landscaping then they get put in that email sequence. So they're on track be and they start getting helpful content related to that service and this is really powerful because these are two different types of customers that have a different goal in mind. So if you started just sending out a mixture ",

                "originalText": "When's the last time you send an email to a friend that looks like this the whole idea here is to casually slip into your customers inbox as a friend or at least has a helpful person that they can trust that's not going to sell to them. But it's going to help guide them in the direction. They want to go so I just recommend doing what successful internet marketers have already been doing and that's just sending out boring old plain text emails and I'm only kidding when I say boring. I mean it sounds boring, but these emails are Much more likely to be read because they just look like a genuine email you would get from your friend or your neighbor or your family member and the other reason to ditch those template emails is because all the images inside and the lynx is the best way to make sure that you never reach your customers inbox, you know, that little promotions tab in Gmail. You don't want to end up there. Okay, you want to end up in the actual inbox where you belong? So let's try to keep those images and links in the email to him. I recommend no more than a single link for email and preferably no images at all. But if you have to use one if it adds some color or add something special to the message of the email go ahead and do one but limit it to that one way. I like to add an image to an email is not by adding a product image or anything promotional but just some kind of an animated gif that either supports one of the points of the email or just add some humor or fun to it. So it's a little more memorable just choose it wisely, you know, you know your audience, you know what they're going to find funny most likely so just make sure it hits home with them and they get the reference. Alright next. I want to talk about Brewer remove this year. It's something I definitely want to start incorporating into my overall email marketing strategy. So rather than just delivering a tip or advice in the email make it count for more by including a really short story that illustrates that point. There are whole parts of your brain that just light up and fire off when it hears a good story. Plus it makes it more relatable and ",

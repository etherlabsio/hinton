We I'm just trying to put quick key phrase / entity graph that would help which can go into such tanks key free service. So we'll start there and then see how that will help with the filtration and to and then take it from there. So so I'm working on it. I should have the Ether in ether keyphrase graph bye-bye today most it's there. I just need to do some tests on that and and on the other side regarding the custom Minds. We just realize that the data that we've been using was little noisy. That's the that's the that's the reason why the model wasn't consistent with the other models. So we didn't is the data and then we are going to Arjun is going to train a new model that will that should improve And then make it make things clear for a customized. And on the I think that the first one is done sighs, so Trisha and just acknowledged currently, it will be right now. It will be AC. So the the in the communities may not make much sense because of the coverage but usually what I would expect in an optimal way would be to most of these iOS and under anything a general software engineering should take precedence. Otherwise, it won't cover most of the Ether engineer it won't rank. It might be bad. Because it's a semi but if we fix this ether engineering model, we should be able to revert it back if the things are in line with their domain models. ",

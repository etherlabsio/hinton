There will be a pollution. I can put the time also, that's okay then it's like a number less. My point is why don't you just take a chance and just from the date? Hope you don't know that you - repeating same data. You can collect multiple meetings same at the same time is when we it does not include the time. ",

It's so we will get started started that way and then see how it works out. So so what what it means is that every every mind could be associated with the Carolyn pizzas mind which is like for each animal have its own keep this graph accordingly. It will show the key phrases only if it is present in a few say it has occurred in at least one or two calls. So that way we can at least say sure that we don't see a bad words that Usually occur by very bad transcription and The Coincidence is in there that it's consistently pronounced that way. What what I'm thinking too is to will put this in summaries first and then next turn the to the chapters little later. ",

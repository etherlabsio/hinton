And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and I'm sure everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it. But basically what we decided to do was that customer success was going to own all of cells and how we Define an upsell actually was anytime sales closed and account under a parent company customer success would own that entire parent company relationship. So if we closed Pepsi, It was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and Mountain Dew and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that. Those can be like massive opportunities that customer success was now owning that relationship instead of sales. ",

We actually look at things monthly as well as quarterly and yearly so for us the fact that like someone would come in and say hey, I'm really interested in finding out about getting an account for my sister. Company we say yeah, hold on one second. Let me pass you to a sales rep then the sales rep gets on the phone and says hey give me all your background which oh, by the way, they've just given to the customer success manager and then and then as soon as the sales down there like oh by the way here go back to your customer success manager. That's really frustrating experience for the client and you're talking about tacking on days on each side of that transaction and when you're talking about things in months and quarters those days really matter.

We set very aggressive meeting quotas. So what we found out very quickly was and this is going to come to no shock to anybody in this room. But the more meetings you have especially in person meetings the higher the Epsilon value the way more likely that you were going to sell into that organization and we rebuilt the comp plan. So, of course if you're going to have customer success managers managing up cells have to comp them a little bit more like salespeople. So what we did was we took everyone's bonus structure and instead of making that based on you know, We kept a piece that was going to based on renewals and churn and business objectives. So they had that piece and then they also had a commissioned piece so they could essentially earn as much money as they possibly could with that upsell. So quotable. This was a quote actually from one of my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsells who knew so basically what we did was when putting in these meeting quotas we said like the more you talk to your customers the more you are going to sell. I promise. You the better relationship you have the more money that's going to come in. They're going to want they people want to spend money with people. They like with people they talk to you all the time. Not just people who are helping them in a crisis. So I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun here and I'll go a little bit to our results and then I'm gonna go back to why we think it worked.

So I'm the director of customer success at bit. I we are based in New York and have been a bit leave for about two and a half years which makes me the fifth oldest employee a bitly at the moment. So I feel like I've been around the block a few times. Yeah. Let's see. So my team we've got about we've got seven people on the team right now. We're hiring aggressively and then just a little bit. Out badly so badly you guys all probably know billion some capacity. If not go on Twitter. And the first thing you pop up will be a bitly link. I'm sure but we were established in 2008 to solve like a very real problem on the web which was that links were too long to put in Twitter when Twitter started right? So pretty basic from there. We've expanded we have about 60 employees. We have three offices New York Denver and San Francisco we have about 1200 Enterprise clients. So the first question I always get when I say that I'm the director of customers accessibility is how does Billy make money and what does it mean that you manage accounts at Billy? A lot of people don't realize that we have an Enterprise product. We have about 1,200 Enterprise customers. We've got 9 million for users and both of those roll up into the customer success team which presents a unique challenge in and of itself. And we kind of the size and scale of Italy is also interesting. So we shorten about 600 million links a month see about eight to nine billion clicks and I'm about 2 billion unique. So go through our system every month. So just a little bit of background to sort of understand the size and scale. So now I'm basically just going to take you guys through the story of like what we did. If Italy not saying it's like the right model of the wrong model. It's definitely a different model than most people and it can be a little bit controversial at times when I talk about this. So to take a step back as a beginning of 2013. Teen and we were in stage 4 2014 planning now. I'm sure none of you have ever seen a chart like this, especially since it's been in every presentation that I've gone to today. But basically what happened was this water. This is what our sales growth numbers look like for 2014 and the conversation started. How are we going to get there? ",

You looking to work with the first thing many people will always ask is what is it going to cost me or what's the price of this? And as I said before in other videos, it's generally never the price but it's the value that they associate with the service that you provide. But if you qualify effectively using some of the questions we've outlined here related to budget it can help you ensure that. That you don't waste time trying to engage with the prospect that really has their interest in engaging with you and spending the money on your service. So what are some of the questions you can ask them in order to build a clarify the budget situation? Maybe I'll ask the question has a budget been set aside for this or how much is this problem costing you so that you can focus not just on the cost but on the potential return that it can give the prospect or how do you typically get approval to spend your budget questions? Like these are simple questions that you can ask to be able to get into the mind of the Prospect and find out what's really happening is money there to be able to move forward with your project or is this something they're going to have to then go? Get from another source. One of the difficult sometimes to think questions to ask is is there a budget set aside and how much is that? And I always say to my customers to be able to ask questions such as typically in a project of this nature the budget ranges from this to this. How does that fit with your plans? And those type of questions enable you to really understand what the prospect thinks to that sort of figure and whether that can meet with their budget plans expectations. Qualify effectively around budget and it's going to save you a huge amount of Heartache further down the line the next key element, which is really essential in your qualification process relates to Authority the end of the day in business.

I was with a client the other day who felt that the person may be presented with was the director and therefore the ideal person to make the decision when they probed a bit further they find it had to still go to a board who then made a final decision to always be able to ask the question as to where that Authority lies. Some of the questions you can ask include is there anyone else involved in the decision-making process in addition to yourself or can ask who sets the budget for these type of programs or what does the decision-making process look like at your organization? How does that work asking those questions really helps you identify who's going to be key to making the decision so that you can engage with those people make sure you have the right relationships in place to get the decision that you want. One final tip that I always say to my clients as well as don't be in a position to say to someone are you the decision maker because people will invariably say yes because they feel like they want to look important. If you feel that there could be someone else involved just say to them apart from yourself. Is anyone else involved in making this decision which then enables them to build a show they're important but also involve other people if they do have to go up through a hierarchy in order to get the decision. Focus on Authority who's going to make the decision around the project or service that you offer and try and understand what's key for them in making that decision do that and I can assure you it's going to give you a massive help when it comes to then being able to move your project from in a potential into a reality the third aspect.

Of course, there is a skill in being able to engage in closing the right way, but I talk to my customers a lot about how the majority of objections happen because you have not qualified the opportunity clearly enough there are lots and lots of great models that you can use to help you qualify the prospects you have but in this video So I'm going to share with you a model. I think works really well and is a great way for you to start building sales success and additional skills by qualifying your prospects using the bank process. Let's take a look at the video and see how we can use bant to get you better sales results. When you engage with a New Prospect for the first time one of the key things you've got to do is to be able to qualify them to see if there are fit to work with your business. And this is one of the areas that I see so many small businesses fail to do effectively when you qualify a prospect through the questions that you ask you give yourself a better chance of a scene if you can work them in the future, but be be in a position where you then don't get further down the sales process and find Barry's get in the way of you making the sale many of those berries can be addressed. If you qualify effectively at the start of the process and I've always said to my clients that there are different models. This champ is G PCT, but I really like the model bant as a way of being able to help you qualify your prospects effectively. Let's talk through band what that model is and how you can use some of these questions to get the better sales results. ",

Once again, so many prospects engage. I've been there myself of made the mistake or I've engaged with the prospect over a period of time but a great relationship agreed. They've got a budget agreed. They were the decision maker and then find out that actually they weren't even going to do anything until the end of next year. Frustrating when that happens you commit lots of time on you what that time to valuable over the course of the next two to three months and the prospects got other ideas. So maybe look at some questions that you can ask to have to clarify the time scales that your prospects working with questions such as what kind of time frame are we looking at here to get this problem solved or what has made you look into this now or what has presented prevented you from fixing this before. So look at the elements that Involved in the prospects mind around the timing of the project what's causing them to actually want to do this. Now what's making them think this can wait for a period of time and I always believe the time is very well linked with the need and the problem. It's a pressing problem. They're going to want to act upon it quite quickly. So there are four areas under the bank process budget Authority need and timing that I think you can use effectively with the questions that you ask in order to really assess where your prospects are. If you can ask the questions in the right way using the right tone member and my videos in the past I've talked about how tone is really important a question such as what is the budget for this project will be received differently to a can you show me what is the budget for this project the You engage in approach your prospects will make a big difference.

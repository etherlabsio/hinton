So it literally was a page with everybody on our platform. So if you want to go there and just search the page and see if the person you're looking for was there you couldn't search profiles you can understand who had the expertise you're looking for and this ran like that for nine months and it wasn't till after looking at the data understanding the the different areas that I'm going to share with you guys today and realizing that we are lacking the opportunity for real growth that we added the search and search our growth was about 10-15 percent month-over-month. It literally spiked because of search which is an obvious thing if you're building a Marketplace, but in the early days, we were kind of living to lies of this productivity tool and wanting to kind of allow people to get more call volume and connections and get paid for their advice. But I want to share with you guys those three inputs. The first one is really the market needs, which is the first thing that I totally did not pay attention try to ignore and building my company Clarity dot f m And the market needs are exactly what they expect and what they express, you know, literally if you're building a solution. There's expected needs of your customers. They're coming in with an expectation of what it does. And then if they don't find it they're going to express those needs and you need to be able to capture that information and put it on a list of potential opportunities to improve but that's a big bucket that it's kind of like a Venn diagram of inputs to build a great product strategy. Number one is the market needs number two. To is the business goals, you know, every business number one goal is eventually have a business model that makes money. So profitability that's a business goal. You might have a goal of growth. So you need to hit certain Milestones to be able to become Ramen profitable. Maybe sushi profitable maybe raise your first round of seed funding but those are real goals that need to be understood so that you can guide your product strategy to deliver on those outcomes. So Market needs and to the business goals. The third is key. ",

I don't know how to say it is we that's it. We're getting t-shirts made. It's all about the product stupid. Three inputs required to create a great product strategy. If you're a SAS founder, you're literally pulling your team every week back and forth between focus on this focus on that or your customers are just like not feeling like they're getting what they expected from your product or literally you have no vision for the product or maybe you have like something two years out but nothing concrete today. I'm going to share with you guys the three inputs the three areas you need to focus on two. Meet an incredible product roadmap that you have probably never considered when you do this, right? You can literally have a six-week backlog of features and Bug fixes and growth features that are really enhance the product. Everybody will understand what they're working towards and it'll be like a factory floor of just development and deployment and development and deployment and just make your customers crazy excited every time you do a new release. That's the opportunity if you understand these now I understand because when I was building clarity I literally was like had a mindset. I was like so focus on creating a tool. Okay. So Clarity ended up. So this is a fiber ended up being a Marketplace for entrepreneur is to get advice over the phone. Okay. So is like Airbnb for entrepreneurial advice over the phone what it started off as was a tool and mobile app that allows you to create a call list. And when we finally launched this in a bigger way and we had all these incredible members users experts you could call them on the platform. We told everybody like they're there and now these experts are willing to take calls, but we didn't have search. ",

I call these product hooks things that get the customer to engage that gets them on an aha moment. And that is how you differentiate but it's the key feature. So if you think about the three big buckets that you need to understand to build a world-class product roadmap for strategy is the market needs the business goals and finally the Key features now. I know that it can seem overwhelming because you might only have yourself to build this or maybe you have a couple of the people on our team. I'm going to share with you a strategy straight from the folks at IBO Ido is one of the number one industrial Design Studios in the world and they have this belief that we've always adopted in. My product teams is that you separate this is huge you separate ideation from prioritization meaning that the first part of a meeting you can do this in the same. Meaning you have an hour product strategy me. Incorporate those three big buckets of inputs into that list and then really just focus on quantity numbers. Here's the problem. How do we solve it? Give me ideas. Give me ideas. Give me ideas. You can just sticky note and put them on the wall sticking out put them on the wall. And literally it's about quantity. That's the ideation step the next part of the meeting. The second part is all about prioritization starting to group those ideas starting to prioritize which ones we do and what order based on Market needs business goals and key. Jurors of differentiate your product that is how you start to streamline and create a product strategy. That's compelling. That's exciting that your customers Rave about that allow you to achieve your goals to continue growing and scaling the business now, I want to hear from you below in the comments. Let me know. What's the one thing you're going to change around how you focus or ideate or maybe how you extract the ideas to work on but I want to know what are you going to do to change the way you design product in your business? Leave a comment below as for usual. I want to challenge you to live. ",

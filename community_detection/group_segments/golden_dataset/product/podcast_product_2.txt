I meet a lot of people who really excited about, you know, kind of starting their career as a project manager. But when I talk to them it turns out absolutely no idea. What a p.m. Does a lot of people think that a product manager is the same as a project matter, you know, some people think that a product manager is just like a general manager and you know, they think that he has nothing to a technology. So I think once and for all I really want to make clear what the hell does a product manager do so you must have heard a lot of people say that a p.m. Is like a mini CEO of his or her product. But what does that actually mean? Right? What do you mean by saying that someone is the mini CEO? You must have also seen that classic Venn diagram that a p.m. Sits in the middle of business Tech and user experience again, you know, that's that's more. Jargon unless you kind of understand what that means. So p.m. In my opinion does everything that is required to ship a quality product to the user right in Broad terms. It can be broken down into user and market research business strategy and business modeling building a great user experience for your product getting the product built from a technical point of view. And then finally taking the product to market. The first thing that a p.m. Does is understanding the user and understanding the market right as a p.m. You're building a A great product for your users. You're trying to solve problems or your users, right? So understanding. The user is a core part of what a p.m. Does. How does the PM do it? Well, there are multiple ways, you know, people do surveys people do interviews people do sit with the users and see how they're using their product people just look at data to see how users are using the product. There are multiple ways of how you actually go and in-depth understand your users, but that's really a really large part of your role as a p.m. The second thing that a PM ",

Have them give you feedback here their abuses take their feedback and kind of do this process again, unless you till you feel that you've kind of hit the nail on the head and I'm ready to move on to the next stage of actually building the product but now comes the actual build phase which is the grunt work, which is actually building this product and this experience that you Vision here you will be working with the team of Engineers to actually build and ship the product that you envision your core role as a p.m. In. This space is actually making sure that everyone is rallying behind the vision that you've set for the product. Remember you're the advocate for the user. The thing with Engineers is that they'll always want to solve the hardest problems the problems that they find hard the problems that they find challenging for. Those are not necessarily your users because problem Remember you have to make sure that the entire team is aligned on that single Vision that you've set out for your product. The second important role in this space for you is to make sure that we ship the product on time and you do whatever it takes to get it done if that means that four nights in a row you're making and giving coffee to your engineers you have to do it because shipping products on time is one of the key metrics for a good p.m. So now that you've defined the experience of your product you work with your engineering team to get it built. The next thing that you would spend a lot of time doing is actually thinking about how to take this product to Market typically for a b2c product. This would involve two things one thinking about why new users would adopt a product. Like what is the compelling features that will get those users to try and use your product and then communicating this effectively to those users. The second thing is growth. What can you build within the product such that your product reaches more and more and more? ",

I'm part of numerous product management collectives of thousands of product managers and we all help each other product management of fairly new role in the industry. And so we all help each other to grow and solve problems and become stronger managers together a strong sense of good design think this is really important. Like you may not be design. I don't have to be a designer be a good product manager, but you have to have a good sense of what really good design is have to be on behan. It's looking at what the best designers in the world are working on how to have a strong sense of what good design is what's going to be successful understanding business fundamentals again, one of the reasons entrepreneurship is so great as a background is as a product manager you have to also understand the financials behind it. You're going to be doing marketing and sales after the products created as well to supporting the Marketing sales team. So you have to have really good understands just understand just a business fundamentals in general and again a passion for building building is what I love to do whether it's a business or to product. That's always when we're doing for the rest of my life. You have to want. Building you want to be building really good teams and really good products and just one thing is I learned majority of my skills as a product manager by failing and it's the best way to learn. I was like saying losers fail and stay down and Winters fail on stand up. It's kind of like the model live by and I just try and fail as often as I can and I'm going to have a lot more failures than wins. But um when I win we're going to win big And I want to help. So if anybody's interested in product management, please get in contact with me. This is my email. You can reach out to me on Twitter and my medium is well. We're on producing a number of different articles and Max you going to be publishing one next week on how to land a job as a non technical product managers article. I'm working on now. So thanks so much. Thanks biztalk Sean. This is awesome guy. This is awesome. Thanks guys. ",

I was actually going to go to UC Davis and major and exercise biology because I want to be a doctor but turns out if you can see the sight of blood when you're getting a syringe put in your arm. It's probably not the best thing to do. So I switched the business and I came to Chico State because they had a great entrepreneurship program during my years of Chico State. I started this company called Soul ID. This was how I gained my knowledge in development and Design. Sinai self-taught myself all this I'd say 80% of my education from the University came from just building companies and building Soul ID. It was a huge learning experience for me and the one that I experienced I can have and it was fueled by all the mentorship brought here from Chico State and just a shout out. If any of you are looking where to go what to do in business. The entrepreneurship program here at Chico State is probably the best place to start to just really around yourself out and it's just an amazing program in general so in doing this was Soul idea, it was an amazing experience. It's a large social network for Action Sports. And again, I didn't know how to design I didn't know how to develop Greg Bellinger who's in the audience. Here is the Chico State students when we co-founded it together and we self taught ourselves all this and basically I didn't even know it but I was building out my skills to be a product manager. I didn't even know I was doing that a couple of years later a little biztalk story Greg sagaris is the co-founder of this company called outsell. He's also a Chico State Alum and he spoke at the first bits talks. Just how Asian ships work Sean connect me with them because I was looking to get in the B2B side of business just build a new skill set after a couple days with the gravy hired me to head his product team at outsell. And that's where I work today down the San Francisco Bay area. So what does the role consists of and it really consists of a lot of everything so we do everything from the business development. So we have an opportunity Gap. We do a feasibility analysis. We run the financial metrics and make sure it's actually feasible to work and build out this ",

What's going to look like how the products going to work and function and then we research the design. We do prototypes. We send that to our sample base. We work with clients to make sure that products actually what they're looking for and it's actually going to work then like I said the best part about all this we build so the product managers manage a team of designers and developers are going to build out the actual application and that's what the majority of my time is spent doing is managing these teams and building out these teams so we can build better faster stronger. Anger, then we go on test and Survey the product and make sure it works come back reiterate pivot make it better and then we repeat and we do this over and over and over again. So we're just constantly building and that's what we do for a living. So when I was in your seats out here, I would hear people speak about what they did for a living but they were talking about their job descriptions and kind of like how they got to where they are. But I wanted to know what they did on a day-to-day basis. Like what do you do when you walk through the door sit down and get on the computer? What do you actually do? Because I want to know if I actually want to Do that. So on Tuesday. I actually documented what I did that entire day at a high level. So Tuesday morning. I walked through the door. I have a warning stand up with my development team. We have offshore developers. We have Stateside developers. And so we bring all those Minds together and do that in the morning so we can connect overseas and we talked about what we worked on yesterday what we're focusing on the day and what we're focusing on the day after that. So we get the whole team set up then sales development as a product manager. I know the products better than anybody else on the team, so it's my job. Also to do sales support, so we have a major client. That's we were trying to sell to I'll go on with SVP of sales and help them sell that product and demo it to the potential client. Ux UI design. I love designing a self-taught myself either design. It's one of my favorite things to do. I do it as a hobby. Even I spent a good chunk of my day or try to find a few hours to design the products. I work with our designers. I tend to be really Hands-On with design process because I want our products to look incredibly sexy product research. ",

Are we going to make this or we're going to buy this and integrate it into our existing products and platforms. So I'm doing a lot of product research and figuring out what's out on the market what we're competing against and what we can actually buy then development check and usually comes in the afternoon. I check in with our developers. Usually there's quite a few fires have to put out so I'm putting out those fires fixing bugs and make sure we're still on track at the end of the day. I do a lot of documentation. It's really important. For that I document everything that we're working on. So when we hire new developers when we hire more product managers, they can jump right into the process and we're not don't have this lack of Education trying to train them on what we're working on and then I try and do more writing. I'm trying to do a lot of thought leadership and share about product management. What are the best practices and do actually a lot of writing recently on medium and in other places as well. Then at the end of the day try and spend a couple, you know, 30 minutes just thinking about the next day thinking about the next week what we need to be focused on what we need to be doing and are we going the right direction? So what does it take to be a good product manager? How do you know if you're a good fit for this position? You don't have to be technical off tons of people that come out to me like then I don't have a technical background. I don't think I'll be a product manager. You don't have to be technical. I wasn't technical I self-taught myself. You don't have to have a CSS background to do this. But you have to have a really good work ethic. You have to work really hard at this. There's a lot of pressure on you. Your products are supporting the entire company and everybody's coming to you and you have a large team and you're moving really fast. If you work really hard at this to build up the skills to do it be curious is another Point like always be diving deeper looking how things work breaking them as often as you can and then fixing them a true interest in technology again product managers primarily lie and tech companies. You have to be really involved with the tech scene. I mean, I went through college just loving Wired Magazine ink magazine. I was highly involved the tech scene. You have to have a true passion for that because that's where you're going to live be gregarious. I got a lot of help I didn't do this on my ",

So thinking about product management, which is not an option here currently at Chico State but we're going to I'm going to talk about how to get there if you're interested in and what the actual role is. We're working on making an option here at Chico State but that stick so I think the first thing to do is really Ali kind of Define what product management is because you guys have really given me the opportunity to kind of clear the air because it's been really hard for me to describe what I do for a living and a lot of people are really confused often. So there's a lot of truth behind this. I don't think my parents really know what I do still. I think a lot of my friends don't really know what I do still but we're working on that but the the short answer is that product managers build you can consider us the construction management of technology and it's Complicated but to frame it up product managers usually rely and live in tech companies. There are other Industries as well, but primarily function in Tech. So what we see here is a Venn diagram showing these your user experience team. So this is the team that's designing out the software solution. So let's just think of Snapchat is example. So there's a team designing out the Snapchat application. Then we have our technology team this consists of our developers and Engineers that are going to build the actual software and then we have our business team. So the finance the Marketing sales behind that Duct for let's just say Snapchat again in the middle of all this is the product manager to make sure this all goes as planned and product managers can have somewhat of a minimal role in the business and somewhat of a major role in the business as well. But again, essentially what product managers do in a nutshell is we build and we build all the time and that's what we do for a living. So a little bit about how I got in the building is I started building companies when I was in high school. I started a clothing company called aspect out of my parents. ",

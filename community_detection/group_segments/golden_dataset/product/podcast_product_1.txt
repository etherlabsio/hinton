Right so one of the questions that I get asked the most is what are actually the skills needed to become a good product. Right? So product management is actually a very very broad domain. It has a mixture of hard skills as well as soft skills. So there's no easy answer to this, but let me try my best to get you. Going to begin. Let's first talk about the hard skills that you really need to become a good product manager. Well, the first most important skill that you really need is a problem-solving attitude. It's something which is difficult to teach but it's easy to practice, you know, when you're faced with a problem you try and find unique interesting feasible solution to it or you like a pause. This is too difficult. I don't have that problem solving attitude is the first thing that you need to become a good product management. Well now that you have a good problem-solving attitude. The next thing that you really need is a strong passion and understanding of Technology. Now, I don't mean that you need to be like a kick-ass border or you know, you need to be like a gadget geek but you really need to appreciate and understand how different products apps web. They work. How do they communicate with each other? And how is technology really used to solve problems for users? Because that's again your for job also. You don't want to get laughed at by Rangers. You pretty much need to figure it out. The next thing that you really need to do is have a deep understanding of your users do not building the product for yourself or your friend or your mom. You know, they may love it but is a good chance you don't really invest in understanding your users. No one's going to use your product for a lot of products. The users might not be someone that you directly related to write if you're working on as a matter or an Instagram you may use it your friends may use it. ",

You know, like you have to pass on all the Goodwill to your team while all the bad stuff. You know, it's just gonna come to you and people are going to mop the floor minute. So really it's through your vision. It's through your Clarity is through your understanding of the user that you have to like combine this team motivate them and like, you know have them going and running in One Direction that's very very hard to do for that's very important to be able to hear. Well, the second very important soft skills that we really need is this ability to strongly communicate with your teeth, you know, you'll be working with a lot of people like someone will have some idea somewhere around to do things differently. It's a murder respect everyone, but it's also important to Rally everyone together, you know behind a common vision and for that you really need to be a good communicator and I don't mean that you need to be able to like give a rousing speeches or you know, like just rile up the crowd actually written communication is something very very important again, you don't need to have Shakespearean English, but you need Clarity of thoughts and you need to translate that Clarity of thought on paper so that everyone can kind of follow what you've envisioned for your product. But the third piece of skill is really having a strong ability to take the fact as a p.m. I can tell you there's going to be a lot of negative feedback. You know, your users are always wonderful. You dissatisfied. However, good your product maybe everyone in our company thinks they know how to improve the product and you doing something wrong, you know, so you really need to have this ability to take a lot of feedback. Absorb, it. Don't take it personally see what you can learn out of it and really use it to improve their product. Right if you're getting freaked out by every small thing people say that oh, this is not working properly or this is I think this could be done in a different way. Then you're going to really struggle, you know, just just be smart about it and remember what to filter out and what to really take and the final soft skills. That is very very important is ruthless prioritization. You know, you have 20 ideas on your plate some of your own. ",

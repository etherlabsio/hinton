      "There may be something so we just have to see how well it works only in those cases.\n",
      "Sorry, one other question is kind of related to that one.\n",

      "So you are starting to talk about a bunch of new things in that case.\n",
      "I mean, this is just a discussion, especially with example, if you are summarizing YouTube and things like there may be a case where let us say, for example, you do not want to help each other.\n",
      "And so the first few times are assigned to summarize YouTube discussions.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "It is just a copy when you when you associate it is a mind to a channel but what we have what we do moving forward is along with the domain mind.\n",
      "So right now at least in deployment currently, we have default minds and then after that we have customized Man which we manually have to think alike either engineering mind or if you want to have something separately camel in ether a moment.\n",
      "So a bit from my side the main thing is like the enrichment of the mines so initially, right right now we have some kind of a ranking in place for all those default Minds which we currently have and we are moving away from that and looking into continuous enrichment of all these mines for each and every channel.\n",
      "So initially, we have only default mine and then one single ether mind.\n",
      "So right now we kind of have to have a specific set of files for every channel.\n",
      "So right now what we are doing is like we are trying to have some specific set of files for each and every month for each and every channel basically.\n",
      "At least for testing what we do you like we created a separate Channel with started with default SE mind and SC my ether graph and everything.\n",
      "Uhhuh for the first call we go with the main domain with as I said every mind would be associated with the key phrase graph the default Keepsake.\n",
      "So for the problem with the Aether calls is the transcripts are in perfectly good because of basically how we speak and of the converse so that is something which we have yet to come.\n",
      "Probably we are going to get about XnumberX XnumberX communities, right?\n",
      "Even for the ether engineering will be the behavior and then then see if we need to see can do minor modification just to make it Tyler made for this but otherwise from the flow perspective.\n",
      "And then after we ran an initial test just to get its what the user would feel when they just start the first call and we just progress with two more calls and in which all its data and the again ran the first call try to see how the enrichment process works like how the being effectively works.\n",
      "So should we switch either in this seat and lab should we switch it to just software engineering mind so that we get a feel for water real customers are going to audience dumbs of that is a summary communities.\n",
      "Yeah the end of how do we get a feel for what our customers are going to experience?\n",
      "Bracket from from the domain wins every time when you channel is created size of currently.\n",
      "Each side would have its own Associated additional pipe that carries recency and other other aspect of it.\n",
      "So that still works mainly because of the cause which we ran which were mainly podcast with and US accent.\n",
      "So I was just wondering like see for example in either engineering today.\n",
      "Like for example, today we have in our call this call.\n",
      "That is the domain key phrase graph that means for now.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "So what we can do is see with the reason I am gonna mask in all these cases.\n",
      "So we do not need to be high to release IOS app is what I am saying, like make sure that it is it works.\n",
      "So if we can take that part of then I think we can be done by Monday.\n",
      "Yeah, I was actually able to start on Witnesses who I need another two days minimum.\n",
      "I can also summon to plan starting the campaign on Monday.\n",
      "So once this is done, then we can start to look at a couple of other things which is showing just handing the mole.\n",
      "I do not think we have like block users and I was yet, but if on a trip on the web if you feel like on Monday, we can have everything ready.\n",
      "But because the websocket integration make Four Paws assume a pier it is a bit different from the logic.\n",
      "I will try to computer the Monday or Tuesday with the websocket part.\n",
      "I know we have said we will be having a different apps after that.\n",
      "Like I did not get a heads up if I had to test iOS.\n",
      "We just focus on the experience they share right what the end user experience right and try to get it as seamless as possible.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "My point is I am okay with pollution the likelihood of it happening is very low it will be even higher because we think that we enter in the meeting names and the set of I was not working before because we used to create uuid is to join the car as a room ID and the source of the rating and they would use the uuid this unique nonrepeatable.\n",
      "We need to know check for you know recurring rules when the start incomes and that that is that is still in imputation it.\n",
      "And very understandable name is said we had a discussion how to creating an object of things that we have a recording deletion recording objects at can look into no generic meeting scheduling.\n",
      "What what I am doing is to create a keyword graph that with without the key verse ever recorded and then we do not show the keyword or any Associated subject if you do not see the key phrase at least in one or two meetings.\n",
      "Clarifying questions on those site you want to see what happens when you have the first columns in the channel.\n",
      "It will show the key phrases only if it is present in a few say it has occurred in at least one or two calls.\n",
      "So for the First Column we will do a mapping of the key phrase with whatever if this is they have been able to exact from the Mind from the model.\n",
      "Yeah, that will be a little unfair because we will not know we might not know lot of key phrases from the first call.\n",
      "But because as you said it is not it is not really feasible to just you know, ignore all the key phrases if we if they do not occur in the in the dictionary.\n",
      "There is a calendar API from Google we can check what are the events that I should be with me this minute.\n",
      "So by that we can we can start, you know, the disease has a hangout color can still go ahead and join a hangout called even though the\n",
      "So so what what it means is that every every mind could be associated with the Carolyn pizzas mind which is like for each animal have its own keep this graph accordingly.\n",
      "So we will do that first and then I am going to figure out what we can do to reduce that impact of aggressive filtration.\n",
      "What what I am thinking too is to will put this in summaries first and then next turn the to the chapters little later.\n",
      "Yeah, I think there are few of us left on the from the Russian side.\n",
      "I mentioned that we are still trying to grow their approach to get started.\n",
      "So that way we can at least say sure that we do not see a bad words that Usually occur by very bad transcription and The Coincidence is in there that it is consistently pronounced that way.\n",
      "It is so we will get started started that way and then see how it works out.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "So I am adding these connections and just trying to check on next teaching data if I can get some insights which can help in like filtering or recommendation and all this side.\n",
      "But the like it kind of shows that if if you keep reinforcing then they could be a chance that we will have some solution to like cold start problems or better connections and building sites from video.\n",
      "Yes, a so update from my side is like I like first time in like Esther standardizing the graph population and adding new connections and everything.\n",
      "Okay, okay, and for that are you know getting the proper even when you do start like when recording client stars and things like that?\n",
      "Yeah, so there is another able to pinch back end sense called recorder recording started it is that recording once it uploads a segment to the SXnumberX.\n",
      "Yeah, we are getting the events early like we discussed when recorder joins will fire.\n",
      "Then it file exchange transitions from not static to started so that time they send the recording object.\n",
      "Now the initial that immediate see the recorded is enjoying like it is continuously join, but we like put overlay of the video and we mute audio in recorder if through a we capture.\n",
      "I have edit the code for it, but request not sending that so I am debugging that it should be a small fix so they will start getting that event.\n",
      "I see some good positive things like if there is like a new called which do not have any references, but if I go and check for references in the entire workspace, then we still find some Related keywords related entities so that way it is not very conclusive yet.\n",
      "I was working on the model showing up like it is almost done like I am taken the full from the partial has Mansion like it will be integrated with the web socket.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "I am just fixing it like so the momenttomoment to join the meeting you just exited a collar you close a tab, right?\n",
      "Yeah, so the that that is still going on that work wherein we can simulate the existing meeting and just produce the summary that part we have discussed and we have finalized the implementation approach.\n",
      "So like it was reverted on witness day because like Misha was having difficulty in continuing because she faced internet connection issue.\n",
      "So those meetings when they click on it will be saying that recording is not available.\n",
      "So those things are also will show up in the recent meetings.\n",
      "We we can go up to let thousand meetings at a time at a time.\n",
      "So what the side effect of that is when you keep scrolling down there might be a delay in getting the meetings out basically in the recent meetings\n",
      "Meaning we used to have a lot of causal connections like when users crawls down, right?\n",
      "All right today, I guess the that the the other part is adding the form validation, but I guess we can add that in your when you give to get to it, right?\n",
      "It user will be able to see the meetings which are actually Lee started and ended but recorder did not join.\n",
      "So Anisha had faced one more issue related to internet connection.\n",
      "One is showing that basically a we used to do a parallel careers.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Hopefully we can get all the modal dialogs and also the iOS playback.\n",
      "So we will try to get the pasta Zoom corruptly back on the web Double D. And then Molly next week.\n",
      "Yes showing that ethercast has encountered and problem create start another cars and been on okay, we are exiting the call if the corded window in in one minute.\n",
      "From WordPress site because I have seen before we received transitions from pay plan to free Plan before when someone beans salsa to Satori go verify that is not happening again, okay.\n",
      "This part is done like handle exit when recorder has not yet joined like for is it is on the prod and I think Lonnie has also done.\n",
      "So it will still receive the participant left a flash participant leaves even in Cosmo it will end the call.\n",
      "So I guess it will work now, but it is a currently slow.\n",
      "Once we fix that computer moving the cursor approach it will all be solved.\n",
      "So let us just say focus on these things related to you know related to the cost, right?\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "We can then more than push sometimes like to second half of next week.\n",
      "Give the same as the and sing that is in parallel.\n",
      "It is already there in staying for a couple of days we can and I just realized on smaller today is there with that implementation and fixing the ones that are than I we can push it to production.\n",
      "Anything that will have to do for this cast is you need to push the a we capture changes that we have done recently production.\n",
      "Like Siwon only after we push all the cost related changes.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "So this info so this information comes from the grouping highlights, right?\n",
      "I am also trying to infer if I named entity is ready to key phrase just by looking at the substring and all the so if there is like if you look at chapter there is this key phrase called SQL queries and SQL is it self identity so they both get connected saying that they are this key phrases related to introduce.\n",
      "So then these new connections are basically like trying to interpret like implicit connections between users.\n",
      "So when we give summaries which we show that when cut tree and chew gum spoke about something so I so I go and create connections between wankers free and Suba saying that they got group together then And then over the meeting or I am trying to increment this frequency count.\n",
      "I delete it will if there are new usually keep key phrases would be written and they are not entities.\n",
      "So if we if you do not find it we might have to filter out with the with the current approach because we do not know that if we if we if we do not know what the difference between like the Gypsy and Gypsy that they are the same unless we have a context about the them\n",

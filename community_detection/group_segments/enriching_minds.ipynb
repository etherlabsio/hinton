      "So what we can do is see with the reason I am gonna mask in all these cases.\n",
      "So if we if you do not find it we might have to filter out with the with the current approach because we do not know that if we if we if we do not know what the difference between like the Gypsy and Gypsy that they are the same unless we have a context about the them\n",

      "So for the problem with the Aether calls is the transcripts are in perfectly good because of basically how we speak and of the converse so that is something which we have yet to come.\n",
      "And then after we ran an initial test just to get its what the user would feel when they just start the first call and we just progress with two more calls and in which all its data and the again ran the first call try to see how the enrichment process works like how the being effectively works.\n",
      "At least for testing what we do you like we created a separate Channel with started with default SE mind and SC my ether graph and everything.\n",
      "Like for example, today we have in our call this call.\n",
      "Probably we are going to get about XnumberX XnumberX communities, right?\n",
      "Okay, so let us switch to see mine for ether engineering.\n",
      "I just want to say that to see if it will catch an action items.\n",
      "So that still works mainly because of the cause which we ran which were mainly podcast with and US accent.\n",
      "Yeah the end of how do we get a feel for what our customers are going to experience?\n",
      "So should we switch either in this seat and lab should we switch it to just software engineering mind so that we get a feel for water real customers are going to audience dumbs of that is a summary communities.\n",
      "So I was just wondering like see for example in either engineering today.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Yes, a so update from my side is like I like first time in like Esther standardizing the graph population and adding new connections and everything.\n",
      "It is just a copy when you when you associate it is a mind to a channel but what we have what we do moving forward is along with the domain mind.\n",
      "So right now at least in deployment currently, we have default minds and then after that we have customized Man which we manually have to think alike either engineering mind or if you want to have something separately camel in ether a moment.\n",
      "So a bit from my side the main thing is like the enrichment of the mines so initially, right right now we have some kind of a ranking in place for all those default Minds which we currently have and we are moving away from that and looking into continuous enrichment of all these mines for each and every channel.\n",
      "So initially, we have only default mine and then one single ether mind.\n",
      "So right now we kind of have to have a specific set of files for every channel.\n",
      "So I am adding these connections and just trying to check on next teaching data if I can get some insights which can help in like filtering or recommendation and all this side.\n",
      "But the like it kind of shows that if if you keep reinforcing then they could be a chance that we will have some solution to like cold start problems or better connections and building sites from video.\n",
      "So this info so this information comes from the grouping highlights, right?\n",
      "So when we give summaries which we show that when cut tree and chew gum spoke about something so I so I go and create connections between wankers free and Suba saying that they got group together then And then over the meeting or I am trying to increment this frequency count.\n",
      "So right now what we are doing is like we are trying to have some specific set of files for each and every month for each and every channel basically.\n",
      "Uhhuh for the first call we go with the main domain with as I said every mind would be associated with the key phrase graph the default Keepsake.\n",
      "Bracket from from the domain wins every time when you channel is created size of currently.\n",
      "So for the First Column we will do a mapping of the key phrase with whatever if this is they have been able to exact from the Mind from the model.\n",
      "I am also trying to infer if I named entity is ready to key phrase just by looking at the substring and all the so if there is like if you look at chapter there is this key phrase called SQL queries and SQL is it self identity so they both get connected saying that they are this key phrases related to introduce.\n",
      "That is the domain key phrase graph that means for now.\n",
      "So then these new connections are basically like trying to interpret like implicit connections between users.\n",
      "But because the websocket integration make Four Paws assume a pier it is a bit different from the logic.\n",
      "I see some good positive things like if there is like a new called which do not have any references, but if I go and check for references in the entire workspace, then we still find some Related keywords related entities so that way it is not very conclusive yet.\n",
      "Each side would have its own Associated additional pipe that carries recency and other other aspect of it.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "It is so we will get started started that way and then see how it works out.\n",
      "Clarifying questions on those site you want to see what happens when you have the first columns in the channel.\n",
      "What what I am doing is to create a keyword graph that with without the key verse ever recorded and then we do not show the keyword or any Associated subject if you do not see the key phrase at least in one or two meetings.\n",
      "It will show the key phrases only if it is present in a few say it has occurred in at least one or two calls.\n",
      "What what I am thinking too is to will put this in summaries first and then next turn the to the chapters little later.\n",
      "Yeah, that will be a little unfair because we will not know we might not know lot of key phrases from the first call.\n",
      "But because as you said it is not it is not really feasible to just you know, ignore all the key phrases if we if they do not occur in the in the dictionary.\n",
      "So that way we can at least say sure that we do not see a bad words that Usually occur by very bad transcription and The Coincidence is in there that it is consistently pronounced that way.\n",
      "So we will do that first and then I am going to figure out what we can do to reduce that impact of aggressive filtration.\n",

      "So a bit from my side the main thing is like the enrichment of the mines so initially, right right now we have some kind of a ranking in place for all those default Minds which we currently have and we are moving away from that and looking into continuous enrichment of all these mines for each and every channel.\n",
      "So initially, we have only default mine and then one single ether mind.\n",
      "So right now we kind of have to have a specific set of files for every channel.\n",
      "So I am adding these connections and just trying to check on next teaching data if I can get some insights which can help in like filtering or recommendation and all this side.\n",

      "Uhhuh for the first call we go with the main domain with as I said every mind would be associated with the key phrase graph the default Keepsake.\n",
      "Bracket from from the domain wins every time when you channel is created size of currently.\n",

      "That is the domain key phrase graph that means for now.\n",
      "So then these new connections are basically like trying to interpret like implicit connections between users.\n",

      "It will show the key phrases only if it is present in a few say it has occurred in at least one or two calls.\n",
      "What what I am thinking too is to will put this in summaries first and then next turn the to the chapters little later.\n",
      "Yeah, that will be a little unfair because we will not know we might not know lot of key phrases from the first call.\n",
      "But because as you said it is not it is not really feasible to just you know, ignore all the key phrases if we if they do not occur in the in the dictionary.\n",
      "So that way we can at least say sure that we do not see a bad words that Usually occur by very bad transcription and The Coincidence is in there that it is consistently pronounced that way.\n",

Probably we are going to get about 15 20 communities, right? Yeah the end of how do we get a feel for what our customers are going to experience? Right?

It's so we will get started started that way and then see how it works out. So so what what it means is that every every mind could be associated with the Carolyn pizzas mind which is like for each animal have its own keep this graph accordingly. It will show the key phrases only if it is present in a few say it has occurred in at least one or two calls. So that way we can at least say sure that we don't see a bad words that Usually occur by very bad transcription and The Coincidence is in there that it's consistently pronounced that way.

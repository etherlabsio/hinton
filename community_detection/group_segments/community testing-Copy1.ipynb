Now, this is a very common term very useful term. But there is a problem with our society or our computer Society be give 0f2, whether people understand that subject or not. We just want it to be technically correct. So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is. \",\n",

This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it's the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start. I'm not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it's explain not where it not rain so as twenty start. I'm not going put a set up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i's now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is the.\",\n",

Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website legislate you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines. But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me. Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who's self-promotion? So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up. Now this sign of feature is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website. It writes a lot a lot a lot of code. We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I. \",\n",

We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written. I'm just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there's a problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key, so,. \",\n",

What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important. So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well. Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now. Also, I would request everybody to suggest me. What should I make next on this channel? I'll be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the. Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing. If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards. I'll try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there. I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I'll try I'll try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook. The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well. But yes, I'll try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up. In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions. So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well. So. \",\n",

The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\",\n",

Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\",\n",

So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages. Now, I assume you happen to have Visual Basic installed in your computer system and you have a third run time environment and the third code editor window and it goes on and on and on the more number of languages you pile up in your computer system.Now wouldn't it be great if you just happen to have only one set of runtime one set of library and one single Editor to deal with programming languages.How Microsoft solved it let's have a look at that.So Inception and what is dotnet framework?. It was July 2000 when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for next-generation Windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\",\n",

Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\",\n",

So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting. So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video. Now in this video. We will talk about what is API or also known as application programming interface.

So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API. What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature. You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and. \",\n",

You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \",\n",

Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\",\n",

Also, I would request everybody to suggest me. What should I make next on this channel? I'll be looking up on the comment section of each and every one comment so that I can get the topic of the next video pretty simple. It sounds now one more thing. If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards. I'll try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there. I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I'll try. I'll try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook. The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well. But yes, I'll try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up. In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions. So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well so that I can give you exact timing when I would be live. And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey, did everyone thinks you're back again with another video? And in this video? We're going to talk about Docker after watching this video. I promise you that the. \",\n",

Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on. What is API rather?. \",\n",

Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some alternate uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\",\n",

    "By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.\n",
    "In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine.\n",
    "But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they are running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer.\n",

      "By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.\n",
      "In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine.\n",
      "But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they are running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer.\n",
      "This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.\n",

      "For developers, it means that they can focus on writing code without worrying about the system that it will ultimately be running on.\n",
      "It also allows them to get a head start by using one of thousands of programs already designed to run in a Docker container as a part of their application.\n",
      "For operations staff, Docker gives flexibility and potentially reduces the number of systems needed because of its small footprint and lower overhead.\n",

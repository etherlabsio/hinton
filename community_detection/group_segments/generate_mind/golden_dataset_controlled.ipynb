I have been playing around with the bot mean with the cost allocation and trying to see how well I can use it in a bunch of different cases and it's only as no only when you as a user you try to use it to try to figure, you know, you you know works or not. There have been a few issues that I've noticed. just the first issue is that Of course on the playback when the Parson resume happens the playback is still very jittery the you know, I've highlighted this a couple of times in the last week. This is something that I think we need to fix at least before we go and tell folks that we need to you know that we can use pause and resume. One of the things that we also have to do is to try and see if we can make the pasta Zoom more easy to access on the lower controls instead of being hidden in settings again most of the times I think for the this this is something that we it's not our ship blocker, but at least blocker but it's something that we should probably try and add soon thereafter. \"], '2020-01-01T16:17:06Z', '8d6db5f7d9b74c54ba38fe710ffcaf3f', '7d9bc03c-a1fe-4adf-b8f4-151715f0cbad']] \n",

We don't see this on iOS by the way because I know iOS we actually hide the fact that the recording client is there so on the iOS client, it actually shows up nicely but on the web on the desktop app most of the time you're seeing The Ether recording client when you're recording a cast, so I don't know if this is something that's fixable but Something that we do definitely need to take care of. Okay, the third thing that I noticed when doing this was it takes a while for the for ether to join when you start the call and often I found myself starting the cost as soon as you join we may want to consider showing some kind of a we know that the recorder client has not yet joined as we keep falling I think on the client so we may want to either you know, show some kind of a warning that you know, that ether is getting ready for the cost and you know show that the uterus ethercast is ready only when the recording client join the something \"], '2020-01-01T16:18:49Z', '8d6db5f7d9b74c54ba38fe710ffcaf3f', '9a3c8dd4-076a-4d2c-8864-1cd0b1e9907d']] \n",

But rather than reading out a list of architectural Concepts, we will approach that a completely different place by me telling you a story that you really need to know. Let is go back in time to the old days when we did not have anything called micro services. Theyll go to a time when a computer was big enough to fill the room. Mr. Seen pictures of one of these things you would walk up to that computer. Fast forward a little bit to desktop machines again programs recite it on the desktop machine the programmer application contains all the instructions that are needed to execute. So when people would write applications for it their code would be compiled down in the whole thing would be installed on the computer in one go and it will be installed on the same computer think of purely desktop only apps. Okay, something like Microsoft Word or a text editor that you install on your I mean this has historically influence how we write code when we need to write an application. We would start a new code project and we would add functionality into that project need more functionality add more code. And so the size of the code base for any given application keeps increasing over time. So what starts as a small code base might end up turning into a large complex code base over time and people realize this.\"\n",
    "text = \"Nothing too fancy, but overtime web applications have started becoming better bigger quicker more complicated bigger scale bigger user base bigger everything and today we have web applications that can you know find something from the whole internet in a matter of milliseconds are fine. What cabs are available around you all over the world in milliseconds. These are incredible Feats if you think about it, and they need incredibly complicated code to be Developed and applied and this complexity becomes harder and harder to maintain. We have nice modular architecture on the code side of things is not that enough to handle the complexity during development time? Well with the type of applications we are talking about the complexity needs to be handled not just at the coding side of things. They also need to be handled at the runtime or execution side of things having a single thing that you would apply. Didnt work anymore this way of having a single application is called the monolithic application or monolithic architecture mono means single lithic means Stone single Stone monolithic. This is the Smosh basically What are some of the disadvantages of this monolithic model first the bigger the deployment the more challenging the deployment Let me Give an example. Let is say you want to push a new feature to your big monolithic application. So among all the code comments that you want to deploy is the single quote comment by this new guy. The company has just hired me not so sure about him. He probably does not know much and he still learning but his first code come it ever is still sitting there. Well, you need to test the whole thing before you would apply the whole application you never know which part of the application that come it might have broken. Well, I am exaggerating here, of course, but the fact remains.\"\n",

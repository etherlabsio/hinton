      " The story told of this older couple from Maine and every year they go to the Cumberland County Fair this particular year. They were standing by the way their names Martha and Stumpy grinder this particular year there were over by the little airport and Stumpy wanted to take a ride on the airplane and Martha said but Stumpy it is ten dollars and ten dollars is a lot of money and somebody said by Martha. I am going to be XnumberX years old and if I do not do that airplane ride, I is not never gonna go. So they started back and forth and back and forth arguing about this XnumberX actually be XnumberX. Finally the pilot said tell you what I will take you up on that airplane ride for nothing, but I do not want to hear a word from either one of you so Martha said, let us go Stumpy. So they loaded into the plane and the pilot and his mind is saying I am going to have fun with this one. He takes off and he goes straight up in the air straight down flips over. Looks back not a word not a sound not a word. So he says well do it again goes straight up straight down flips over flips back nothing. So he lands the plane and he said I got to tell you I just took you on the wildest airplane ride I have ever given anybody somebody says well, I was going to say something when Martha fell out but XnumberX is XnumberX. Well, we do want to give them an experience but we want to hang on to them and we want to create that loyalty. So they will come back for the next ride just by a show of hands how many innkeeper is or lodging representation. \n",

So I want to make this directed to you obviously so you can make it pertinent to your own organization. So this afternoon as we talk about the secrets to customer service one of three things may happen. First thing is that you will say I am confirming that what I am doing is right on and it was great what Chris had shared to getting back to really the basics is not it of customer service guest services that Hospitality so that you will confirm that what I am doing is already right number two, you will discover that you have gotten away from the very thing that we need to be doing in the hospitality business in the customer service realm or number three, you will discover that you need to make some changes. wow, you know, we are not even doing that or I need to start implementing that for our people for myself and and for our people so some those are just some ideas as far as what may happen this afternoon in the short period of time that we are together to lay the foundation though for what we are going to be talking about customer service begins where Where does it begin? Okay from leadership from the employer beyond that even if if I am a customer a guest and I am going to your let us say your lodging establishment or your restaurant or where would it begin for me? \n",

So now what we have done is we have reached out to thousands maybe even millions of people we are inviting them to where we are at unless we have an online business, but we are inviting them to where we are at. So we have got the face to face the front door. What about even as they are driving in the parking lot? How many of you have taken a fresh look lately at your parking lot at the establishment. I used to do some work for a farm way out of Bradford Vermont and any of you ever been there. I mean that is a lot of the first things you notice that the grounds is just it is beautiful. Well taking care of the first customer experience often is as they are approaching the parking lot. I would encourage us to take a fresh look at that. What does the customer see what is the guests see when they first drive in so I would encourage us to do that. The other thing is to every single interaction that we have that our customer has with our organization will either cultivate or corrode the relationship.

How do we as employers or owners even incorporate that same kind of mentality that we have for a business that same passion. So be talking a little bit about that the other thing too that we need to know that every single person in the organization whether lodging restaurants attraction, whatever. Even the person that calls themselves private one in the back room are they involved with customer service you betcha. My husband and I were flying back from the Outer Banks last June and we had a layover in Maryland and all of a sudden over the loudspeaker. I am supposed to be gendreau, but it was Carrie Bend row. To the passenger kiosk and my husband looks at me and he says carry, I think that is you and they said it Again Carrie Bend row to the passenger kiosk. I am walking up cause of what is going on in my mind as you can well, imagine death in the family a tragic accident. But anyways, we I am thinking that oh my word something tragic happened. I am going to get some bad news as I am approaching this guy and we are talking about every single call person in an organization is involved in customer service as I am approaching the kiosk there is a guy about this tall and he is got this bright orange yellow vest on so he was the one out directing the planes. He is now in the airport and he is the one that approached me. He said are you carry Bend row and I said well gendreau, but yes, he said you have a dragged bag. \n",

Thank you for letting me know and he said it will be wait what is left of that will be waiting for you in Manchester when you get home and I said well, thank you and it was it was really bad. It was really bad to give you an idea of fact, I should have brought the remnants of my cosmetic bag. It was inside you do not even recognize it and that was inside the back. So when we talk about every single person in our organization is involved in customer service, would you say he was he did not leave it up to the Or the guy at the desk he took responsibility for that which I was very much appreciative appreciative. So the third thing to the customer will either consciously course you can could you be following through with it? Yeah, I should have ended the story because it really was good news. So we get to Manchester Airport is quite late and we had to go to the Southwest. You know, how they have the little secret room there where you have to ask directions to get to I think they board themselves up because they are afraid. So we found the room we went in and there was these two women behind the dolls. That is what it looked like and so I said, I am Carrie gendreau. I have a drag bag and they said well, we have a brandnew one waiting for you brandnew American tourister Beautiful much better than the one I had and they said if you want to look through your bag that was not much left if you want to look through. \n",

Thank and I said what I was thinking was a death in the family and it is only a dragged bag. It is okay they and they just thanked me profusely and I said, oh no will thank you. So the third thing as far as laying the foundation here the customer or gassed whatever we want to refer to them as it will either consciously or unconsciously ask how will eating at my restaurant how will shopping at my store? Do you think that whether it is consciously or unconsciously are they not asking themselves that we do it do not we when we enter a restaurant or we go to a place of retail Place establishment or whatever do not we say I go here because it makes my life better.

She has a XnumberX and XnumberX year old and she pointed to her fiveyearold. Water picture on the wall, and she said that is my pride and joy, and I said will you do a phenomenal job with a bathroom? And I says very refreshing to see the quotes then she pointed to another sign and it said and I quote the best urination station in the nation.

So handle the person first in the problem apologize it Not have been our fault, but say I am sorry you went through that or I certainly apologize for the inconvenience, but do not over apologize because believe it or not that seen as a weakness just apologize and then show empathy you validate the emotions find a solution. Offer compensation if appropriate and there should be no time delays and then followup. \n",

And this Summit is all about you Ecommerce retailers be successful during Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend until a few minutes ago to the top of the hour when we actually begin. So I am just going to wait and watch as people slowly trickle in we have already got a few people in our attendee list. It is it here and please jump into the chat box that you see there is a problem. You can see a chat bubble at the bottom of your screen.

If you watch the replay have not been able to make it alive all the replays it up available on Summit dot gorgeous dot IO and this talk is also being recorded and the You play will go up shortly after so you will get an email about that. But so far in this Summit, we have been talking a lot about the idea and the concept that you know, we all know that ad costs are rising and you know support costs are rising during the holiday shopping season because it is more sales but also the same time the revenue does not rise proportionately because you know, you are probably doing like heavy discount. So in some cases, you know, your margins are razor thin. thing and you know in some cases where you do not do the math and plan and properly then you are probably going to make a small law so that the idea of the whole Summit in the black is to get you two in the black in your financial books, which is make you profitable and so one concept we have been talking about a lot is how instead of trying to acquire new customers all the time and I am not saying it is a bad thing to do that but, you know during the holiday shopping season when \n",

      " Still quite a new customer goes High the focus should be also to make your existing customers and feel good and give them a good shopping experience so that they buy from you again because you know, if you get your existing customers to purchase from you again, the cost is not as much as you know, spending and still get a brand new customer. And so a large part of that is customer support making them feel really good about you about your brand about the shopping experience so that they come back and Shop from you again. and they bring your friends with them as bonus reference sales and that is why I wanted to get the folks of are called Olivia the head of customer success to come and talk to us today about some of these customer support keys that you need during the peak season the holiday shopping season, especially when there is tons of new customers as well and how to get you know, how to provide a really good experience so that they are not just there and getting that one discount and Way, but they are always they are coming back in purchasing more and bringing the friends. So we are at the top of the are almost and what I am going to do is I am going to hand it over to Olivia now. So just give me a warm welcome go into the chat.

We will also be answering any questions throughout the webinar as well as at the end and then we also do have a special discount offer to offer up to anybody who is making the move potentially to a new voice Channel system in the next few weeks or four weeks to come but first I wanted to quickly put the conversation into context of this week is Summit. So we hope that you have been following along with all of the great presentations Sid has helped organize for this week. And for those who have you will recognize this revenue forecast model shared by Aaron from Shopify Plus on Monday. Friday is going to be a very special stressful time for your business. But if you do get it, right this shopping weekend could really catapult your brand your company to a whole new level. But the thing that think really stood out to me through all of this data was that it turns out that black Friday is success depends on much more than just optimizing marketing and sales and my by my count four out of the top five concerns touch customer support in some way. So I wanted to dive a little bit into customer support and what we can do to help keep everything on track for the successful black Friday season. So for the first point the first step in the right direction is taking stock of your team putting them in a position to succeed. It is one of the oldest management principles in the book, you know, no, \n",

But for right now it is kind of too late in the game and we are going to get the best results by using the resources that we already have on our team. So no two companies or two teams on this webinar are exactly alike. So it is really important to understand and consider what makes you and your team uniquely you so there is no need to pretend that everything is perfect either, you know building a perfect plan that your team cannot realistically execute will be bad news for everybody involved. But if you acknowledge those strengths and weaknesses upfront you can create smarter systems that work to your advantage. \n",

I am guessing there is all kinds of Clues lying around in your business data. So assuming that this is not your first Black Friday, you probably have a good idea on what kind of data you have to offer. So how much busier was your support desk last October versus last November. Or and how can it potentially compared to or give you insight into what it is going to look like for this year? And even if this is your first time around you can still get a sense of what things are going to look like like what support channels your customers tend to prefer. What are the top three or four most common request that they make into your team? And how does your sales activity correlate to your support activity? \n",

      " Once you have completed those first two exercises, it is time to really kind of connect the dots. So what organizational setup will give you and your team the best chance to survive the storm coming at them, you know, so a few questions that you want to ask yourself who is suited to be a specialist and who might be better as a generalist. Do you have people that are better suited for quick Fast Fire answers or people who are better at diving down into the into the problems in the nittygritty to find those solutions for those customers. One should agents escalate an issue and move on to the next one. You know, when is it a lost cause we are talking about quantity for Black Friday season as we get the majority of volume around the holiday season, we are trying to turn out as many first touch responses as possible. And who would they be escalating into in these different scenarios? So if you are breaking your team out into generalists and Specialists, you know, when is going to be the right time or what trigger words are you using within the customer conversation? To know that it is about that time to move over and pass it along and escalate the issue. So now that we have the right people in the right places, it is time to take a look into the technology that supports them and your team. \n",

      " Customers can arrive at your support desk by dozens of different routes. There are endless Converse combinations of phone email live chat chat Bots social media SMS selfservice. This is only growing bigger and faster in a survey that we actually conducted at the beginning of this year. Three out of four people said that they were planning on adding a new support channel in XnumberX, which Is insane these channels are just customer fake are just the customer facing side of things too. So the full story of each customer also probably touches a halfdozen of backend tools as well. We have two types of crms that we use, you know, so there is a ton of different products that are kind of working to paint the full picture of the customer before we are able to talk to them. So I actually did want to send out a question to the audience. How many different systems do you think you have storing your customers contacts or data? So you can go ahead and just like chat your reply in and then we can look at the answers at the end of the at the webinar. I am curious to see how how many different systems each one of you has yeah, just off the top of her head on my count. We have support help desk or just itself and then couple of like email tools couple of other crms. So regardless of the exact tool set that we do have you know out of the Even ate that we have the expectations are all kind of the same though, right? \n",

      " We want to handle quantity but also with quality there and as you can see from this slide most companies still are not satisfied with the standard with any kind of consistency, you know, even though the focus is to really Empower your team with a better conversation at the beginning. It is still really hard to paint that full picture of the customer how many times they have called in what their recent interactions have been like so there really is a massive opportunity. T to rise above the competition but also above the standards for your own team. If you can person that experience just even like a little bit. So this is what companies like gorgeous and are call are kind of designed to help you do it a little bit easier than maybe previously so we are trying to push all of the contacts in history of a customer is conversation into one single actionable view. Restart the story from chapter XnumberX every time that they call in or they chat in you can actually resume their conversation where the last time that they left off, you know, so let us say the the chat they left the chat early, you know, we want to pick up at the end of that chat. So they were talking about an order that they had just placed. Well, we do not want to have to restart that conversation and say oh, what is your name again? We want to hop right back into to say oh, you know, this is the last time that we we had a conversation is this where where we want to talk about again, you know, if you are curious what this might look like in your own environment stay tuned later, and we are going to offer a special promotion on that. But if you absolutely cannot make any changes this year, which is quite difficult because we are so close to the Black Friday season. There is still probably a ton of like lowtech workarounds then at that can still help make more of the right customer data accessible. \n",

      " Now that you have your team and your Tech in a good place, it is finally time to address the third variable in the equation the customers Behavior. I am sure we all have some similar traits on our wish list of what of customer characteristics and I believe me. I wish I could control that but we do not have to wait around for these mythical magical customers to appear we can to some extent. Yeah, we wish that the customers were like perfect and they just come and you know exactly what they needed when shopped got it and left without asking any questions, but in reality does not does not work that way and the reason it does not work that way probably because you do not answer those questions in advance. I mean that would be the dream right to be able to know exactly what they wanted or not even not even calling it that because they already know what they they want and they can get the answer by themselves. So part of the trick is to keep your marketing and your sales team accountable is my first one first and foremost you want to be sure that they are not positive promising something that your business cannot deliver and I think this is one of the biggest pain points for customer success customer relations customer support, you know is making sure that you are held accountable and your whole entire company and your team is held accountable for the product that you are showing your customers because at the end of the day customer is always right. Beyond that you should also be helping customers make better decisions. So discuss the differences between products tears and packages and show how real customers are actually using it. So recommend other complementary products if need be a great example of this is the bellroy wallet example, so they give a visual explanation of what fits inside of the wallet. So right off the bat, you know, and the customer knows what they are going to be getting with this. \n",

      " So we want to see is this going to be the right product for me. How can I compare it to what I currently have things like that and also shipping reminders so you can see that big thing these days, you know, we have Amazon twoday shipping free shipping. It is a big one for customers, you know satisfaction at its finest really this is a good example of a Delroy. It says holes for the XnumberX cards because like a you know, you look at any other regular sort of wallet stores. You probably just see like a wallet and you know, this one is made of leather, but that is it and your customers are going to be asking these are questions. And so it actually going to email you or jump on the chat and say hey how many Cuts can it all and then you know, that is that is something that you could just put up there and they would have had to reject you. Yeah, so no matter how good you are getting all of that up front work through you still need it plan for like the questions in the confusion because it is inevitable because there will always be questions that customers have and the conversation will never stop but what you can control is where you send people make it really really obvious where they need to go. So blaze a trail instead of leaving them in the wilderness and make their Our default decision the one that works best for you and your team. So all birds is a really really good example of this. These are just some Snippets of like their product and their website. So once you place an order, they immediately send you to an order status button. So that is the first thing that you are going to want to know how quickly is my order getting their second one big pricing is always a question. So they are going to show you exactly what you ordered the price the total how quickly it is going to get there and all that information. And then thirdly is that last one so making their Default decision on how to reach out to you the one that works best for you and your team. \n",

      " The more that you can direct customers to effectively self help themselves the more efficient your support team becomes right after all the best support request is the one that is never made, you know, if they are not really chatting in that means that all of your questions have been answered really really fun example of this is Death Wish coffee. So they provide category category like suggestions on types of questions that you could potentially had. So at any given one time on the website, there is always a place that you can go to speak directly with a live agent. So whether it is email or chat in that option is always on a page somewhere the top this style and the tone is consistent across the board with their brand and then my favorite part is they use recycled content from like other people so their customer this is a really great example of this Huffington Post created this You know with no in tandem to death which coffee and they actually ended up using it as their own content because it was it was great and it was curated perfectly, you know, so it is like again work harder not work smarter not harder, right? So to sum it all up everything starts with understanding your team the team that you have and how to position them in the best way especially for the season and to be have a successful season and then from there you want To use the tech that you have to really Empower your team to drive those conversations to be as value as possible and valuable as possible. And then also try to shape that customer Behavior towards the strength of your team. But also your product right for anybody that is concerned about that second point.

They you know, they are doing their homework in advance of my conversation and I do not have to repeat myself which is you know, the most frustrating thing for your customers is just repeating themselves over and over again Kara until I hope that answers your questions anyone else have any other questions. She says, do you have any tips for a small team that is projected to be very busy to avoid burnout? I definitely think understanding, you know, the bandwidth of your own team is really important within are call. So essentially it allows you to set a certain amount of time between calls for your customer for your agents. I am sorry to kind of either take a break finish up there after call work to not really feel like they are being hounded by you know, the the increased volume of their customer requests, and I think that is really important, too. \n",

      " You know, like Christina said is avoid burnout you they you know, it is supposed to be a pleasant experience as well for the agents, you know, they should feel proud and happy about the product that they are helping sell and answering questions about and I think you know making sure that they are also feeling valued during this busy season is absolutely crucial. So biggest things I would be if you are using our call that would be a great opportunity there if you have the opportunity within the voice Channel To create some type of Q again to allow that time frame between customer conversations to be spread out a little bit more for your agents as well as working again smarter not harder in pods. You can create, you know certain time frames with where certain agents are working and then they will take a break for an hour. So again, it can get Taylor is to every individual team and Company. Another thing to add is it, you know, you mentioned this in the talk just like going back and seeing what are the questions that people ask, you know in the email and the support in the on phone calls. And if you find that people are asking certain questions very often like you know, what is your shipping policy or return policy then maybe that is something you service on the website so that it is there in front of them and they do not have to ask you. That anymore so that it cuts down on the number of incoming queries like through the phone or through email. And that is the whole point about you know, kind of using the technology that you do have to to really be smarter about the way that you are handling those conversations. So, yeah, so maybe something a good takeaway for everyone watching this right now is to go back, you know, look through those previous conversations, you have had with customers see if there are any patterns emerging any very frequently asked questions and throw that up on the surf on the website kind of like \n",

But rather than reading out a list of architectural Concepts, we will approach that a completely different place by me telling you a story that you really need to know. Let is go back in time to the old days when we did not have anything called micro services. Theyll go to a time when a computer was big enough to fill the room. Mr. Seen pictures of one of these things you would walk up to that computer. Fast forward a little bit to desktop machines again programs recite it on the desktop machine the programmer application contains all the instructions that are needed to execute. So when people would write applications for it their code would be compiled down in the whole thing would be installed on the computer in one go and it will be installed on the same computer think of purely desktop only apps. Okay, something like Microsoft Word or a text editor that you install on your I mean this has historically influence how we write code when we need to write an application. We would start a new code project and we would add functionality into that project need more functionality add more code. And so the size of the code base for any given application keeps increasing over time. So what starts as a small code base might end up turning into a large complex code base over time and people realize this.\"\n",
    "text = \"Nothing too fancy, but overtime web applications have started becoming better bigger quicker more complicated bigger scale bigger user base bigger everything and today we have web applications that can you know find something from the whole internet in a matter of milliseconds are fine. What cabs are available around you all over the world in milliseconds. These are incredible Feats if you think about it, and they need incredibly complicated code to be Developed and applied and this complexity becomes harder and harder to maintain. We have nice modular architecture on the code side of things is not that enough to handle the complexity during development time? Well with the type of applications we are talking about the complexity needs to be handled not just at the coding side of things. They also need to be handled at the runtime or execution side of things having a single thing that you would apply. Didnt work anymore this way of having a single application is called the monolithic application or monolithic architecture mono means single lithic means Stone single Stone monolithic. This is the Smosh basically What are some of the disadvantages of this monolithic model first the bigger the deployment the more challenging the deployment Let me Give an example. Let is say you want to push a new feature to your big monolithic application. So among all the code comments that you want to deploy is the single quote comment by this new guy. The company has just hired me not so sure about him. He probably does not know much and he still learning but his first code come it ever is still sitting there. Well, you need to test the whole thing before you would apply the whole application you never know which part of the application that come it might have broken. Well, I am exaggerating here, of course, but the fact remains.\"\n",

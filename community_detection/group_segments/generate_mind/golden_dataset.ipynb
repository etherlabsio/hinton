He is so and so basically like if there is something called Janus has an entity then we look for key phrase that are like Co occurring within a certain particular cycle of windows. So we might get like a noun phrases like recording record or surveys or recording client and all those stuff. So we EV form connections of this odd, and we try to and Like, you know keep reinforcing it like we tried to populate it every time as and genuine say if it is like rub then as in when it is like data comes in or if it is meeting graph. Then has not been meeting data comes in and then we put a filter that if the edge number of edge connection frequency if it is more than say four or five and use it. So this the connection between entity and key phrase is a valid one. So based on that we can whenever we get a highlight which Is like a bad word like a Sufi or something we go back and check in the graph.

Question is what level of traffic can be sustained rate right now, right? So the fatal error that we would see in PHP are no more once it increase the memory allocation on Locker to about to the max of what the cvXnumberX machine provides which is XnumberX GB is Preservation and Max allocations to confine minimum resolution is XnumberX GB. So that is pretty much solving that class not found exception and Communication. So the next thing I did was I ran if you click on current usage tests bench tests with a sustained time period five minutes. So thousand requests per minute consistent energy coming in five minute period Sarkozy results success ratio, there was XnumberX XnumberX percent success. So between XnumberX finer tools fine arteries, but no fatal levels just that. So one thing we should see is if we can if it is possible. So this is redundancy may or may not help I mean, but that is in a very expensive given the machine size and how much traffic will be giving for that if it is possible to separate the static content like the static initial website like the careers or the main lips their page from Um the woocommerce part then and deploy that independent link that is one way to see that is true.

But rather than reading out a list of architectural Concepts, we will approach that a completely different place by me telling you a story that you really need to know. Let is go back in time to the old days when we did not have anything called micro services. Theyll go to a time when a computer was big enough to fill the room. Mr. Seen pictures of one of these things you would walk up to that computer. Fast forward a little bit to desktop machines again programs recite it on the desktop machine the programmer application contains all the instructions that are needed to execute. So when people would write applications for it their code would be compiled down in the whole thing would be installed on the computer in one go and it will be installed on the same computer think of purely desktop only apps. Okay, something like Microsoft Word or a text editor that you install on your I mean this has historically influence how we write code when we need to write an application. We would start a new code project and we would add functionality into that project need more functionality add more code. And so the size of the code base for any given application keeps increasing over time. So what starts as a small code base might end up turning into a large complex code base over time and people realize this.\"\n",
    "text = \"Nothing too fancy, but overtime web applications have started becoming better bigger quicker more complicated bigger scale bigger user base bigger everything and today we have web applications that can you know find something from the whole internet in a matter of milliseconds are fine. What cabs are available around you all over the world in milliseconds. These are incredible Feats if you think about it, and they need incredibly complicated code to be Developed and applied and this complexity becomes harder and harder to maintain. We have nice modular architecture on the code side of things is not that enough to handle the complexity during development time? Well with the type of applications we are talking about the complexity needs to be handled not just at the coding side of things. They also need to be handled at the runtime or execution side of things having a single thing that you would apply. Didnt work anymore this way of having a single application is called the monolithic application or monolithic architecture mono means single lithic means Stone single Stone monolithic. This is the Smosh basically What are some of the disadvantages of this monolithic model first the bigger the deployment the more challenging the deployment Let me Give an example. Let is say you want to push a new feature to your big monolithic application. So among all the code comments that you want to deploy is the single quote comment by this new guy. The company has just hired me not so sure about him. He probably does not know much and he still learning but his first code come it ever is still sitting there. Well, you need to test the whole thing before you would apply the whole application you never know which part of the application that come it might have broken. Well, I am exaggerating here, of course, but the fact remains.\"\n",

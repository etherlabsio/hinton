And one more part is we ask the customers to add our ether body Melody to the schedule Zoom meetings in the calendars and then we will join only the meetings which we are invited to so these are the two things measure to measure things that we are going to do as part of this room integration.

I've been looking into this Zoom integration part for a few days. So there are two things that we are going to do one is creating a zume app in the zoom marketplace where people can ensure like our slack app. And there we can have webhooks listen to the zoom accounts meeting created and started events and then we'll post it will join that meeting from our web SDK and some These things and send send somebody to the Samaritan the host of the meeting. This is one part of it. And one more part is we ask the customers to add our ether body Melody to the schedule Zoom meetings in the calendars and then we will join only the meetings which we are invited to so these are the two things measure to measure things that we are going to do as part of this room integration. We have done few investigation on this one how to handle the meeting calendar invites and how to handle the cancellations and other things so me and the Visions are going to start working on Zoom integration from today. \n",

I've shared shared the comparison between the previous and the existing one in one of the channels. I can reassure their so but on the flip side what's happening is we can be tend to lose some of the in some of the action items in that aggressive filtration. So so so shubham would be working on trying to with all the tests meetings that we have till date. He would look into finding the false false mispredictions. That is the that is false negatives and then and then see if we can how to handle them.

      "I will be and me and I think articles are for being that Pierre will be can try to merge is today and currently I am working on, you know, deleting the history resources for the deleted recordings because we are just marking them as deleted for more but we will have to eventually delete three objects.\n",
      "And very understandable name is said we had a discussion how to creating an object of things that we have a recording deletion recording objects at can look into no generic meeting scheduling.\n",
      "There is a calendar API from Google we can check what are the events that I should be with me this minute.\n",
      "Clarifying questions on those site you want to see what happens when you have the first columns in the channel.\n",
      "So for the First Column we will do a mapping of the key phrase with whatever if this is they have been able to exact from the Mind from the model.\n",
      "What what I am doing is to create a keyword graph that with without the key verse ever recorded and then we do not show the keyword or any Associated subject if you do not see the key phrase at least in one or two meetings.\n",
      "It will show the key phrases only if it is present in a few say it has occurred in at least one or two calls.\n",
      "What what I am thinking too is to will put this in summaries first and then next turn the to the chapters little later.\n",
      "Yeah, that will be a little unfair because we will not know we might not know lot of key phrases from the first call.\n",
      "I am also trying to infer if I named entity is ready to key phrase just by looking at the substring and all the so if there is like if you look at chapter there is this key phrase called SQL queries and SQL is it self identity so they both get connected saying that they are this key phrases related to introduce.\n",
      "That is the domain key phrase graph that means for now.\n",
      "But because as you said it is not it is not really feasible to just you know, ignore all the key phrases if we if they do not occur in the in the dictionary.\n",
      "So by that we can we can start, you know, the disease has a hangout color can still go ahead and join a hangout called even though the\n",
      "So that way we can at least say sure that we do not see a bad words that Usually occur by very bad transcription and The Coincidence is in there that it is consistently pronounced that way.\n",
      "So we will do that first and then I am going to figure out what we can do to reduce that impact of aggressive filtration.\n",
      "Yeah, I think there are few of us left on the from the Russian side.\n",
      "I mentioned that we are still trying to grow their approach to get started.\n",
      "So so what what it means is that every every mind could be associated with the Carolyn pizzas mind which is like for each animal have its own keep this graph accordingly.\n",
      "It is so we will get started started that way and then see how it works out.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Finally what rot are triangles inside your also transitioning to custom mind when adaptive mind speech three would update.\n",
      "Okay, so we should be able to find a fix for this aggressive behavior.\n",
      "I mean the twins will not blindly go by it self interest in even though we start and then observe the behavior will have to find an alternative for this approach both.\n",
      "I think we can reach our now and then see what the behavior is to see what what comes of SE mind is fine.\n",
      "Even for the ether engineering will be the behavior and then then see if we need to see can do minor modification just to make it Tyler made for this but otherwise from the flow perspective.\n",
      "It is just a copy when you when you associate it is a mind to a channel but what we have what we do moving forward is along with the domain mind.\n",
      "So for the problem with the Aether calls is the transcripts are in perfectly good because of basically how we speak and of the converse so that is something which we have yet to come.\n",
      "So right now at least in deployment currently, we have default minds and then after that we have customized Man which we manually have to think alike either engineering mind or if you want to have something separately camel in ether a moment.\n",
      "So right now we kind of have to have a specific set of files for every channel.\n",
      "So right now what we are doing is like we are trying to have some specific set of files for each and every month for each and every channel basically.\n",
      "Bracket from from the domain wins every time when you channel is created size of currently.\n",
      "Each side would have its own Associated additional pipe that carries recency and other other aspect of it.\n",
      "At least for testing what we do you like we created a separate Channel with started with default SE mind and SC my ether graph and everything.\n",
      "Probably we are going to get about XnumberX XnumberX communities, right?\n",
      "And then after we ran an initial test just to get its what the user would feel when they just start the first call and we just progress with two more calls and in which all its data and the again ran the first call try to see how the enrichment process works like how the being effectively works.\n",
      "Yeah the end of how do we get a feel for what our customers are going to experience?\n",
      "Like for example, today we have in our call this call.\n",
      "So should we switch either in this seat and lab should we switch it to just software engineering mind so that we get a feel for water real customers are going to audience dumbs of that is a summary communities.\n",
      "So I was just wondering like see for example in either engineering today.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Yes, a so update from my side is like I like first time in like Esther standardizing the graph population and adding new connections and everything.\n",
      "So a bit from my side the main thing is like the enrichment of the mines so initially, right right now we have some kind of a ranking in place for all those default Minds which we currently have and we are moving away from that and looking into continuous enrichment of all these mines for each and every channel.\n",
      "So initially, we have only default mine and then one single ether mind.\n",
      "So I am adding these connections and just trying to check on next teaching data if I can get some insights which can help in like filtering or recommendation and all this side.\n",
      "But the like it kind of shows that if if you keep reinforcing then they could be a chance that we will have some solution to like cold start problems or better connections and building sites from video.\n",
      "So this info so this information comes from the grouping highlights, right?\n",
      "So when we give summaries which we show that when cut tree and chew gum spoke about something so I so I go and create connections between wankers free and Suba saying that they got group together then And then over the meeting or I am trying to increment this frequency count.\n",
      "So then these new connections are basically like trying to interpret like implicit connections between users.\n",
      "But because the websocket integration make Four Paws assume a pier it is a bit different from the logic.\n",
      "I see some good positive things like if there is like a new called which do not have any references, but if I go and check for references in the entire workspace, then we still find some Related keywords related entities so that way it is not very conclusive yet.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "There may be something so we just have to see how well it works only in those cases.\n",
      "So what we can do is see with the reason I am gonna mask in all these cases.\n",
      "So if we if you do not find it we might have to filter out with the with the current approach because we do not know that if we if we if we do not know what the difference between like the Gypsy and Gypsy that they are the same unless we have a context about the them\n",
      "I mean, this is just a discussion, especially with example, if you are summarizing YouTube and things like there may be a case where let us say, for example, you do not want to help each other.\n",
      "So you are starting to talk about a bunch of new things in that case.\n",
      "I delete it will if there are new usually keep key phrases would be written and they are not entities.\n",
      "Sorry, one other question is kind of related to that one.\n",
      "Like let us say you are starting to engineering starting a new project.\n",
      "And so the first few times are assigned to summarize YouTube discussions.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Yeah, so the that that is still going on that work wherein we can simulate the existing meeting and just produce the summary that part we have discussed and we have finalized the implementation approach.\n",
      "I am just fixing it like so the momenttomoment to join the meeting you just exited a collar you close a tab, right?\n",
      "So like it was reverted on witness day because like Misha was having difficulty in continuing because she faced internet connection issue.\n",
      "So I guess it will work now, but it is a currently slow.\n",
      "We we can go up to let thousand meetings at a time at a time.\n",
      "So what the side effect of that is when you keep scrolling down there might be a delay in getting the meetings out basically in the recent meetings\n",
      "So those things are also will show up in the recent meetings.\n",
      "So that still works mainly because of the cause which we ran which were mainly podcast with and US accent.\n",
      "So those meetings when they click on it will be saying that recording is not available.\n",
      "Once we fix that computer moving the cursor approach it will all be solved.\n",
      "Like Siwon only after we push all the cost related changes.\n",
      "Meaning we used to have a lot of causal connections like when users crawls down, right?\n",
      "So Anisha had faced one more issue related to internet connection.\n",
      "Let is talk about this display the past resume same playback.\n",
      "So maybe just go into a little more detail on where we are on the web and iOS.\n",
      "It user will be able to see the meetings which are actually Lee started and ended but recorder did not join.\n",
      "One is showing that basically a we used to do a parallel careers.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "So once this is done, then we can start to look at a couple of other things which is showing just handing the mole.\n",
      "We can then more than push sometimes like to second half of next week.\n",
      "I was working on the model showing up like it is almost done like I am taken the full from the partial has Mansion like it will be integrated with the web socket.\n",
      "We just focus on the experience they share right what the end user experience right and try to get it as seamless as possible.\n",
      "I do not think we have like block users and I was yet, but if on a trip on the web if you feel like on Monday, we can have everything ready.\n",
      "Yeah, I was actually able to start on Witnesses who I need another two days minimum.\n",
      "I will try to computer the Monday or Tuesday with the websocket part.\n",
      "I can also summon to plan starting the campaign on Monday.\n",
      "So if we can take that part of then I think we can be done by Monday.\n",
      "I know we have said we will be having a different apps after that.\n",
      "Like I did not get a heads up if I had to test iOS.\n",
      "So we do not need to be high to release IOS app is what I am saying, like make sure that it is it works.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "So from the beginning of the situation, so we need to just check if the subscription of the user changes their easily upon Slack\n",
      "One thing we need to verify is because with the new campaign we will have to ask the people to reinstall the slack app if they are not done.\n",
      "From WordPress site because I have seen before we received transitions from pay plan to free Plan before when someone beans salsa to Satori go verify that is not happening again, okay.\n",
      "Yes showing that ethercast has encountered and problem create start another cars and been on okay, we are exiting the call if the corded window in in one minute.\n",
      "This part is done like handle exit when recorder has not yet joined like for is it is on the prod and I think Lonnie has also done.\n",
      "Speaking of campaigns you mention you want to do the past campaign Monday.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "Yeah, so on Magnolia we had a discussion depend on the navigation still had some bugs and staging like the internet issues.\n",
      "So for the attic is adding a like reducing the first marker offset by one second and adding a XnumberX second setting and so will verify that whether it is like seamless or not in past.\n",
      "So now the The markers are having the modified adjusted offset.\n",
      "Okay, but all the I guess the only changes remaining to be tested in staging for the Rebels on the platform side is it that is also deployed the remind of the past markers using thing pause and resume your whatever partial said like, er.\n",
      "Okay, so I have deployed and the like basically pause embolism through that circuit and it is working like quite well there was only like in first there was it was the makah waited almost a second after the lake cause started.\n",
      "So that time is showing properly the part left is when we reached a pause marker time.\n",
      "Like I have to skip and move it to the Playtime and then modify the timer at the top for this thing.\n",
      "Otherwise, the Marcus are coming properly and after that I have to take up the websocket integration so that it will be faster.\n",
      "So it will still receive the participant left a flash participant leaves even in Cosmo it will end the call.\n",
      "So you will have to actually it will work for you because you are firing the pods called directly, but there would still be a delay when you pause from IOS.\n",
      "Actually now when you pause since is that it has like is using websockets.\n",
      "So because of his job was was getting stuck at the first page.\n",
      "So now I am so I am already working on the father is impart.\n",

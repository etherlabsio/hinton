I'm doing it because I've had so many conversations with other developers people. I meet at conferences where that people will say. I'm really excited about Docker because everybody keeps saying Dockers awesome, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it and I can't seem to find any resources online that help me actually get started with Docker and understand you know what it's actually good for. So we're going to kind of cover that we're going to start off with a high-level overview. What is Docker then we're going to show you with really quick. Just a few lines of code how you can deploy applications and then some kind of various thoughts on it along the way so let's get into it demystifying Docker. First thing we're going to do is we're going to compare Docker to vagrant or Docker to a virtual machine since this seems to be the hangout that I keep hearing from people. Okay, so I get vagrant but I don't get Docker. Well, that's because they're really different. Here's got a very visual people visual demonstration. What vagrant is I'm going to kind of show you real quickly vagrant for those you guys aren't familiar with it. And I'm going to show you how it's not really a fair comparison. So vagrant is the goal is to solve the problem of it works on my machine. It doesn't work on production or it works on my machine. It doesn't work on this other developers machine that happens because somewhere along the road you might be on a different operating system say your machine is a Mac or Windows machine and you're pushing it out to a Linux, you know server that alone could cause problems you might be running Wham form and on your It's a PHP application and these guys are actually running a full, you know, just native installation of an Apache stack or you have a different tool set that you're using then another developer. But any rate your environments are not the same so we solve that by spinning up a virtual machine in our computer. That's the exact same thing. We're going to be pushing to staging or production. So we'll use Virtual Willy's virtualbox and vagrant to spin up one saying a bunch of 1404 machine, which is \"], \"2019-11-26T09:05:31Z\", \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"5a27d3949e4149658cd6733e0574f1a1\"], \"segment1\": [[\"Are you using in staging and production? So here that that is it's an empty machine and then you run your provisioning script against your virtual machine exactly as you would against a chair production. So the provisioning script will install the correct version of node.js or rails or PHP. It'll set up all the user permissions. It'll it'll stall any other software configure anything that needs to be configured. So at the end of the day, these are basically the same environment. So now I know that if I dump my project Coding to here and run it in this machine and it works. It's pretty much going to work when I push it out to GitHub and these servers pull it or I push it. However, you do your deployments when the code gets dumped into these it's going to run the same. So that's vagrant in a nutshell different boxes. We dumped our code into each box. Let's look at Docker and see why doctors actually different so for Docker, we got our machine. We've got our project code and Docker runs off of containers. So I use Docker file which is usually five to maybe 30 line fired file Docker files are really small the dockerfile bills once called the docker image that Docker image contains all my projects code it contains, you know saying installation of node.js has a node.js app, it contains any in installments of programs that I need. And so it's basically my complete application wrapped up in an image now, it's not a full say of bun to machine because I don't need that this image is designed to sit on top of a machine. So from that image, I can then run as many containers as I want until I run out of processing power in RAM on my machine. So this is the virtual machine on my Mac again, and I have my Docker image on the machine and I can run that Docker image and it runs as a container and I can run many many containers in the machine once again till I run out of stuff.

Three the image goes out there that's like your GitHub repository so to speak and now any other machine can run your image. So let's say I call this image. My user name is will our Stern. Let's say I did will our Stern / mind, you know tap that's the name of it. So now on any computer I can say Docker run will our Stern / my new node at and this whole image source code and all will run with the complete environment. I didn't install node.js on this machine. I didn't provision this machine. Because the image has everything it has a complete environment all contained into one so I could run a node js image on this machine this container than has nodejs installed has anything else installed and p.m. And I can also run a rails app on the same machine rails is installed on that container but rails is not installed in this container. So they act like virtual machines, but the really self-contained processes so to speak let me go To show you an image here that I found somewhere online. I have no idea what this puppy dog is about but this is basically the anatomy of a Docker container. So this is your actual web server. You've got your web server yet the host operating system, which is a bun two or even something lighter and it has Docker installed. That's all you need. Docker is installed and then all the apps run as Docker containers and they all sit on top of your host operating system. \"], \"2019-11-26T09:09:31Z\", \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"ff243b4cba284ea79bb67e4ba02275cc\"], \"segment3\": [[\"Sources so they all sit on top of the Linux kernel, they all access the same computer's processor and RAM and that's basically a Docker container you build your image once push it out and now you can run anywhere so kind of in a large-scale production environment.

Hours, basically with these two operating systems do is they allow all the computers to act as one they share all their resources. And so now all you have to do is spin up containers and they all run within your cluster and then if you start running out of overall cluster memory for overall cluster Computing, you just add more nodes. So let's say okay. I'm just going to add 10 more computers to this cluster and now I can run 30 more containers so you can just say Let's once again, let's say this image is called my note app. I can run my note app for times boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Then I can spin up an nginx container and have it load balance these four and then expose a private portal to the real world. So then the real world can access my app. This is our doctor Works. Its really awesome for cloud computing really awesome for cluster Computing and that's where it really really starts to shine. But actually I think Docker is one of my favorite uses of docker. Docker is to just provision a single machine and deploy with no provisioning at all. It just spin up a machine make sure doctors installed and then you can run your containers on it. So that's kind of your brief overview. If you're not a visual person.

We know our neural network has made a wrong prediction, but top of the The Network's figured this out note that our network is yet to be trained during this training process along with the input. Our Network also has the output fed to it. The predicted output is compared against the actual output to realize the error in prediction the magnitude of the error indicates how wrong we are in the sign suggestive of our predicted values are higher or lower than expected the arrows here given indication of the direction and magnitude of change too. Use the error this information is then transferred backward through our Network. This is known as backpropagation now based on this information. The weights are adjusted this cycle of forward propagation and back propagation is iteratively performed with multiple inputs this process continues until our weights are assigned such that the network can predict the shapes correctly in most of the cases this brings our training process to an and you might wonder how long this training process takes honestly neural networks may take hours or even months to train but time is a reasonable trade off when compared to its scope.

This is just one of the several applications of neural networks neural networks from the pace of people earning a subfield a machine learning where the algorithms are inspired by the structure of the human brain neural networks take in data train themselves to recognize the patterns in the data and then predict the outputs where a new set of similar data. Let's understand how this is done. Let's construct a neural network that differentiates between a square circle and triangle neural networks are made up of layers of neurons. These neurons are the core processing units of the network first. We have the input layer which receives the input the output layer predicts our final output in between exists a hidden layers, which perform most of the As required by our Network, here's an image of a circle. This image is composed of 28 by 28 x cells which make up for 784 pixels. Each pixel is fed as input to each neuron of the first layer neurons have one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer through channels. Each of these channels is assigned a numerical value known as wait the inputs are multiplied to the corresponding weights and their sum is sent. as input to the neurons in the hidden layer, each of these neurons is associated with a numerical value called the bias, which is then added to the inputs of this value is then passed through a threshold function called the activation function the result of the activation function determines if the particular neuron will get activated or not and activate a neuron transmits data do the neurons of the next layer over the channels in \",\n",
       "  \"The data is propagated through the network. This is called forward propagation in the output layer the neuron with the highest value fires in determines the output the values are basically a probability. For example, here are neurons associated with square at the highest probability. Hence. That's the output predicted by the neural network. Of course just by a look at it. We know our neural network has made a wrong prediction, but top of the The Network's figured this out note that our network is yet to be trained during this training process along with the input. Our Network also has the output fed to it. The predicted output is compared against the actual output to realize the error in prediction the magnitude of the error indicates how wrong we are in the sign suggestive of our predicted values are higher or lower than expected the arrows here given indication of the direction and magnitude of change too. Use the error this information is then transferred backward through our Network. This is known as backpropagation now based on this information. The weights are adjusted this cycle of forward propagation and back propagation is iteratively performed with multiple inputs this process continues until our weights are assigned such that the network can predict the shapes correctly in most of the cases this brings our training process to an and you might wonder how long this training process takes honestly neural networks may take hours or even months to train but time is a reasonable trade off when compared to its scope. Let us look at some of the crime applications of neural networks facial recognition cameras on smartphones. These days can estimate the age of the person based on their facial features. This is neural networks that play first differentiating the base from the background and then correlating. \",\n",

So here's a question for you, which of the following statements does not hold true a activation functions are threshold fungus.

I meet at conferences where that people will say. I'm really excited about Docker because everybody keeps saying Dockers awesome, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it and I can't seem to find any resources online that help me actually get started with Docker and understand you know what it's actually good for. So we're going to kind of cover that we're going to start off with a high-level overview. What is Docker then we're going to show you with really quick. Just a few lines of code how you can deploy applications and then some kind of various thoughts on it along the way so let's get into it demystifying Docker. First thing we're going to do is we're going to compare Docker to vagrant or Docker to a virtual machine since this seems to be the hangout that I keep hearing from people. Okay, so I get vagrant but I don't get Docker. Well, that's because they're really different. Here's got a very visual people visual demonstration. What vagrant is I'm going to kind of show you real quickly vagrant for those you guys aren't familiar with it. And I'm going to show you how it's not really a fair comparison. So vagrant is the goal is to solve the problem of it works on my machine. It doesn't work on production or it works on my machine. It doesn't work on this other developers machine that happens because somewhere along the road you might be on a different operating system say your machine is a Mac or Windows machine and you're pushing it out to a Linux, you know server that alone could cause problems you might be running Wham form and on your It's a PHP application and these guys are actually running a full, you know, just native installation of an Apache stack or you have a different tool set that you're using then another developer. But any rate your environments are not the same so we solve that by spinning up a virtual machine in our computer. That's the exact same thing. We're going to be pushing to staging or production. So we'll use Virtual Willy's virtualbox and vagrant to spin up one saying a bunch of 1404 machine, which is \",\n",
       "  \"Are you using in staging and production? So here that that is it's an empty machine and then you run your provisioning script against your virtual machine exactly as you would against a chair production.

It'll it'll stall any other software configure anything that needs to be configured. So at the end of the day, these are basically the same environment. So now I know that if I dump my project Coding to here and run it in this machine and it works. It's pretty much going to work when I push it out to GitHub and these servers pull it or I push it. However, you do your deployments when the code gets dumped into these it's going to run the same. So that's vagrant in a nutshell different boxes. We dumped our code into each box. Let's look at Docker and see why doctors actually different so for Docker, we got our machine. We've got our project code and Docker runs off of containers. So I use Docker file which is usually five to maybe 30 line fired file Docker files are really small the dockerfile bills once called the docker image that Docker image contains all my projects code it contains, you know saying installation of node.js has a node.js app, it contains any in installments of programs that I need.

So from that image, I can then run as many containers as I want until I run out of processing power in RAM on my machine. So this is the virtual machine on my Mac again, and I have my Docker image on the machine and I can run that Docker image and it runs as a container and I can run many many containers in the machine once again till I run out of stuff.

There are several problems with this method. First of all, the planning must be completed before any work begins and in most cases the planning is done without entirely understanding the project once development is being done often times things get sent back to the planning phase and the project either means to start over or the developers are has criticized for not understanding the plan. This cycle can happen many times. What development is done building the product gets thrown over the fence of tests where when problems are encountered. It bounces back to development and sometimes back to planning the same issues occur in the next few steps with lots of back stepping and doing over this can lead to length times and many months to several years in order to get a product out the door with scrum and implementation of agile. The process is broken. The smaller pieces first when you just not planning to get started with building the minimum feature set. We build what was planned next we test and review that small feature set and get it ready to ship. When that cycle is complete we end up with a potentially shippable product. This process usually occurs in a time period of one to three weeks. This is then repeated time and time again reducing the time from planning to development to testing each time through the planning process. We're doing just enough planning to complete the next incremental release you end up with several incremental releases called Springs a Sprint usually takes from one to three weeks and you just keep repeating these Sprint's until your product is feature complete. \",\n",

Each pixel is fed as input to each neuron of the first layer neurons have one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer through channels. Each of these channels is assigned a numerical value known as wait the inputs are multiplied to the corresponding weights and their sum is sent. as input to the neurons in the hidden layer, each of these neurons is associated with a numerical value called the bias, which is then added to the inputs of this value is then passed through a threshold function called the activation function the result of the activation function determines if the particular neuron will get activated or not and activate a neuron transmits data do the neurons of the next layer over the channels in \",\n",
       "  \"The data is propagated through the network. This is called forward propagation in the output layer the neuron with the highest value fires in determines the output the values are basically a probability. For example, here are neurons associated with square at the highest probability. Hence. That's the output predicted by the neural network. Of course just by a look at it. We know our neural network has made a wrong prediction, but top of the The Network's figured this out note that our network is yet to be trained during this training process along with the input. Our Network also has the output fed to it. The predicted output is compared against the actual output to realize the error in prediction the magnitude of the error indicates how wrong we are in the sign suggestive of our predicted values are higher or lower than expected the arrows here given indication of the direction and magnitude of change too. Use the error this information is then transferred backward through our Network. This is known as backpropagation now based on this information. The weights are adjusted this cycle of forward propagation and back propagation is iteratively performed with multiple inputs this process continues until our weights are assigned such that the network can predict the shapes correctly in most of the cases this brings our training process to an and you might wonder how long this training process takes honestly neural networks may take hours or even months to train but time is a reasonable trade off when compared to its scope. Let us look at some of the crime applications of neural networks facial recognition cameras on smartphones. These days can estimate the age of the person based on their facial features. This is neural networks that play first differentiating the base from the background and then correlating. \",\n",

So here's a question for you, which of the following statements does not hold true a activation functions are threshold fungus. The error is calculated at each layer of the neural network see both forward and back propagation take place during the training process of a neural network.

With time database Technologies evolved a lot while usage and expected functionalities of databases have been increased immensely times of dbms. Let's see how the dbms family of with time. the following diagram shows the evolution of dbms categories  Are four major types of dbms. Let's look into them in detail hierarchical this type of dbms employees the parent-child relationship of storing data. This type of dbms is rarely used nowadays is structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields. The Windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes. Network dbms This type of dbms supports many to many relationships this usually results in complex database structures RDM server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational dbms. This type of dbms defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations unlike the network dbms. Rdbms does not support many to many. Shows relational dbms usually have predefined data types that they can support. This is the most popular dbms type in the market examples of relational database Management Systems include MySQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server object-oriented relational dbms this type support storage of new data types. The data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database. Debase have attributes for example gender or age and methods that Define what to do with the data postgresql is an example of object-oriented relational dbms. So what is SQL?  To query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as SQL is actually the standard language for dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records. That doesn't mean SQL cannot do things beyond that. In fact, it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more. Relational databases like MySQL Oracle mssql sybase Etc. Use SQL SQL syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different syntaxes and even proprietary SQL syntax has an example of an SQL statement. \n",

That means not to not to consider identify the right data sources or the right channel for the commendations and everything and and on the direction of memory. So I think we have couple of approaches at least. I've been thinking of it and then we have couple of approaches as this call happens to it. We can we can actually Find a possible mine for it on the Fly itself. And then use that mind to generate the first pass summaries. So if the user is fine with that summary, then we can we can we can publish it or or even if the user picks up the channel most likely the summary the summary the the Mind used for summary as on the channel would be associated with the same mind so we can even eliminate in some cases. We can even eliminate the second.  Correct.  Is to Auto detect the mind in order to mind during their initial one ya later on if we need to change it will change it others will just push it.  Yeah, yeah, because now we use graphs for the mind. I think we the auto detection can be a lot more flexible than earlier. I mean then the current production of course. \n",

Those things are already emerging to look will be I have two shoes and regeneration and still looking into that. Once that is again energy to develop that person. So there are good. You know that we need to do connectors or that happened. Once that is done. We can even wash things that are pushed as part of the email will be used from my side.  Yeah, so am I said I've written a simple service the calendar service which parses the emails and pushes an event saying current calendar event has been generated. So I will push this change and open up here for this. So once this is done myself and um, she will sit together and try to integrate so that Zoom can listen to this events and take appropriate actions. As of now there are no tables which is maintained by calendar service. So Zoom has to maintain its events table and process accordingly. So apart from this change there was one more like one more change related to recording uuids yesterday was not able to test it. So today I just ran a test in staging it's working fine. So alas function with them to take a look at it.  Is your husband question rate for meeting neighbor nodes? Both of these are already in staging to but right now it's not in production. Yeah.  Alton what I was wondering was yesterday, it looks like all the uh changes are also there on the back and changes are also there but we've really not integrated and tested them.  So I think foxes out.  But maybe I don't know if I just seen him on slack just in case he's up just to check with him to see what he is waiting on.

      "Yes, I thought action items. What I'm doing is I'm increasing the number of negative labels and trying to figure out how the results how the Precision Precision then is coming out of it so that way and I think that the results will improve so so I'm training using that paradigm.  In that what So currently we have very less positive labels for Action items. So so what what I am trying to do is I'm trying to train the model or I'm increasing the number of negative labels and trying to train it on that so that and check the patient's value so bad that I think what will happen is model. See how how the negative labels it will try to learn from the negative labels and From that I'm trying to I'm trying to see how the results are coming out to be. So I'm experimented experimenting on that. We'll see how the results are coming out.  Thinks I should act like I think like we discussed last week, right? So more than key phrases which are even when we are observing in the entity summaries. They're pretty noisy and very not be absolute. So maybe we should we should consider instead of using literally key phrases. We should consider entities and the extended key phrases to those entities like that I have maybe we'll be able to see now as we can we can test that. I don't know. Where does your heart attack? after the  Amazing. Sorry denoising is one part like we can use entity graph could be noise. The existing key phrases of users that we have indygraf. But but still we just have our eventually we will have just good quality entities and good quality key phrases only has  So this problem will still remain is not at this level, but it will like it will maybe become slightly accurate, but it will still be there.  Yeah, the meeting level.  Mating level. I think we can rethink. I don't think we can use the same approach for Segment level and meeting levels.  So is any we cannot rely on just key phrases? We need like more data points. So we will have to start persisting the other information like so for every group we get for example a when cut and and when cursory and shubham discuss this store, you have to go and connect these three users. And so that has to rehab. Yeah, and if you get other kind of data, like click click data's and all those things I will basically augment the info information, but if we just go on key phrases and spoke context for now then yeah, so then like we will get results like top three of them will always be most of the time correct, but it we cannot guarantee like higher stuff.  Yeah, so you can see if you if you check the search engine - test and then you can see keep it loose. So most of the time it is correct. Like whenever there is talk about are a part Pro and all those things we suggest deep and Nisha and others and when they relate language model and all those things it suggests ml team people when it when it is mixed as in when we run like a podcast Car.

So the first step is advances APA is ready then on how we will be able to quickly show the summary right? Like that's it.  Correct. Yeah.  But today I think today it will be done send it for review peer sim.  Okay, here they go.  So primarily we're working on distilling and conditioning the summary is based on mines. So that's in that's in progress. We had decision is today on how we should proceed and we have a loose except few low hanging fruits that we planted this like when we have a meeting communities that we like the current summary we plan to score against the mind which which is going to be entity graphs and then and then distill only give out only like top five or six. I mean we are not fixing to the number here. We don't know how that turns out to be. It's going to be a little aggressive. So we we are we are experimenting with you approaches for those two conditions distillation and Minds at a high level and then on the action items I think will will shiver miss work testing. Testing and trying to find out what are the Mist Mist action items are or the false false predictions and take the take the do the modifications accordingly. So sigh well as we discussed I will just start looking at the decisions also because what we have observed is some of the action items which which which doesn't sound like an action item, but they have enough confidence. They they happen to To sound like decisions as well. So we'll see the coverage of that to start with and then see if we can if you can just start publishing them. Actually. We have an interface for decision also, but we currently we just send an empty empty payload for the decision placeholder. So I'll start populating that I just need to test it on few few calls and then see if that's consistent observation and then we will take a call on that. If not  Decision detection has to be a separate service altogether most likely not but inverse case which is different from the action item service. God and I think on the on the recommended watches the one current approach is in staging to so we need to sink on that. I will sync with session and then and then see if we if we need to test it more or we can move it into production. I think I think we need a little more testing because because of this noisy meetings that we make test meetings and all we just need to be noise. Mundane start recommending. If not, it's actually the recommendations are very random because of the noise input. So I think that activity isn't isn't fully complete. We just need to do that and then and then see how the results are. \n",

      "Take a I am currently working on the red Network bar issue. So I found the six yesterday. I am testing it and like I need to change that logic of it and I need a fix for link when you start doing menu regression that seems to not have been fixed. So I will reopen the issue. I will work on that, too.  I'm working on the notes and cast view. So yesterday I was working on the error handling. So now the dialogue presents and the when the user enters the meeting name of the notes after that it goes away in the loading activity indicator shows and if there is any error another alert will pop up like usual or throughout the year. And the activity indicator also we had a discussion. So it was taking so it was dealing like it was shopping the UI without any other synchronous process. So remove that and using the default activity indicator of react native now, I have raised the pr so also did some refactoring which was like there was a comment in the pier today. I will work on changing the dialogue. To make it more like in web like the background color. And so will create a custom UI for that currently using a library will remove done and we'll handle the notes cases. Like if you don't if you don't enter a URL in case of notes then I'll show an alert in the same dialog box.  That has to either cancel or enter the URL to start. Can you call?  like that  Like they know this week if we can get the at least a meeting name and notes URL changes completely deployed in production. Both of the web apps in iOS.  Yeah, okay. So this is including the change we discussed yesterday or the canceling the  No, no no. Yes.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Sure.  so that we can be able to pass portions and then being able to that's  Yeah, we headed this question on the timeline yesterday or tomorrow. I'm planning to give it in staging like I'll update the pier today. So hopefully it will be closed when \n",
      "\n",
      "No, not really. So if we if we finalized on the current communities distillation and mind I think that that's it. We just need to do the additional any additional paper. There is no nothing specific with it.  Got it.  Biz auto-detection logic in place. That's it.  When got one more question, like for recommended Watchers, we don't have a filter of people only from the same channel meaning like if it is a private Channel others cannot even see even if it is red.  Yeah that is there. But but I mean to to the example of MLA, right? So most of the engineering team is also part of right so that that's where the problem comes but we have to be precise in.  Public channel it's okay. Like can be ended up member can be from engineering Channel. But if it is a private Channel. That's taken. Correct that's taken care in the in the ETL itself. So it won't go beyond that. Yeah. I'm just talking about even in a even if  First group channel, so it need not be for everyone, right?  Current. Yeah, that's where this initially we can let the algorithm do its thing. Okay is  figure out who the recommended watches are  Let's and then if we need to do additional filtering will do.  Yeah.  Okay, so you mean irrespective of the Peace?  Well is it seems sometimes the within the point like you may have to have access see that there's a lot of other things right? Like she's you may have you may be having in the public Channel Sign in which case anyone can access it in private channel to make sure only the members are so on and so forth.  I move that the appointment already being the graph itself right based on Sample membership and all that. But again, I'm not sure so what it is, it's not that let's not worry about those constraints right now. Let's figure out what the algorithm determines to be the, you know to be the recommended watches and see if we can get that right and then later on we'll look at filtering if required. Okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, like today, I deploy to the staging to and testing all the features like till now. I found two issues. Like when I hang up from the closing the window, you're not end the call and I'll look into that and one movie. She was that again if I start call from the dashboard it says memory leak.  Today, I'll be working on those two. The rest part is working fine since aging is it in stages?  One quick question just for my benefit. Did we turn off lost and in the sea?  Production is not but I tried testing in my local but it didn't make any changes.  Lost and he's like the one the person when last person changes that time the behavior what it should be.  I thought she had a configuration setting for last step. Yeah.  Can we turn off in?  Shop, I'll just raise the Pia.  Because right now there's this problem that video sometimes doesn't come right like everything seeing this evening.  Calls. Okay. So once the second else if ever recovers one more thing is like I suspect that it is because of our logger also like initially when I was working in this like when I had well circular Jason it used to throw error in my console and that time only I used to get a camera fails to capture.  Whenever we see the black screen that time we see on the console like circular Jason error might be related to that that is fixed in this new digital integration.  Yeah, like whenever we have a circular Json to print in the console, we just have to like Destructor it and then we should print intend or console the small function we show.  Let me just put that back into current production.  Sure, okay.  So one you only this circular Jason fixed can be added to production it along with the new changes.  That is independent.  Okay, let's try to add it to like magic to don't try to push it to production. Let's see that fixes the vaccination.  action life remove the last turn in this change only on  This is the one that is causing it.  And they say the video. Okay, if it still doesn't address any way will I return of love?  shells  Hey, yeah. Yeah, that's fine.  Hey.  External not sure if the front-end team knows I know that we did like the fixes for the web API dialogue right like basically getting the meeting name from written costs and then also the URL for notes that I think there are some back and changes that was dependent on right.  y'all  You know who like who's working on that for Mackin?  Looking into that but I thought we have done with the we are done with those changes. I'm not sure I get acquitted him. I will sir can do a quick change for that.  Adding the meeting of the cast. Okay? No, I think the meeting name is the missing field there. We didn't have the meeting name option in the front end. We used to regenerate the names for this change. We need to add a field where we accept the meeting name entered by the user from their Bank.  Yeah, basically what I'm trying to figure out is what would it take because I thought all the work related to this was done. Yeah.  Is also in the same you can I will check with method Once on This one. Let me see if anything has to be done.  Okay.  Somebody's in there. cast I guess we just need to figure out how to you know, how to Do the terrible skin of the portions and cancel and start that may require separate asthma? Okay. I'm sure you want to change the cell phone talking Zoom innovation. \n"

      " Text:  everyone they share back again. Now, in this video, even talk about what is A.P.I. are also on this application. Programming Integration. Now, this is a very common Adam Bay you spent on. It is a problem in our society or a computer society. Begin zero f with people understand that some trick or not, we just wanted to be technically correct. So if you look up for the A.P.I. destination on any platform Wikipedia block, they are technically correct. That's one part, but they're not so much understandable. So in this video, we're going to make sure that you understand A.P.I. what is A.P.I.? And after watching this video, you never, ever watch any video on A.P.I. or block because you will be understanding each and every bit off idea. So let's get started. Let's talk about what is A.P.I.. Now go ahead, open up your favorite. Start changing and try to look up for What is it? Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here. A.P.I.. What is it? A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system. Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle. That means we don't get it. What disease Yet? The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I. will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point. Understand? Here's the problem. The people who are already using the A.P.I. I don't mean to understand. What is it? Yeah, because they know about it. But the people who don't understand the FBI, we need to target at people. You need to make sure that they understand. So let me give you a quick example, and I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation, bored very quickly. the example of the guy is very simple. Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping. I remember the example. This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.  Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes. Maybe four search engine may be producing moving logger inside of them features. Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.  Hey, no problem at all. I'll give you a A.P.I. key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I. key works. So yes, that is it. This isn't This is your A.P.I.. Now, there's no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area. It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging. The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I. off Facebook and Google on. You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark. I'm not gonna put any satellite into the space. And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there. Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards. She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that's I can use that API that would be much more important. So varies all how and maybe tell the I'll try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language. You might want to initialize that feature. get everyone. Be sure Buck again with the video. And in this video we're gonna talk about Docker. After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you. And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me. So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed. The first and the only gold we'll be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem. Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem. So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve. never, never, never develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time. Markers. Well, that problem is whenever you're designing a project, it was absolutely fine in your machine, the developer machine. But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody's else computer. Maybe your friends are maybe a manager. This computer. In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place. Although here we're talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum. Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net. Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly. Maybe the palace is a little bit different. All glitchy and solve these cases. That is a cla*sic example. When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place. It doesn't work like that. So the cla*sic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the cla*sic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check. And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.  dinner and these containers are the absolute heart off the Docker. These containers wrap up your entire code on these are absolutely portable. The portability is both absolute charm off the Docker. Now we can dig this container and bay where you're going to put this country that it's gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine. Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb. Well, the cla*sic example is, whenever you're learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging. I'm not talking about the GHB Paschal package. I'm talking about just the score, my a*s. Cuba. It's one of the most challenging thing. Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody's running Windows, Mac and violence. It's not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer. So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container. They're super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks. He's the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you're running from the networking information that you're running. And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something's in your code. So in order. Summarize. Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you. Number one thing. It's a client side application program. You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking.  \n",

You can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint and start there and lost, but not the least Docker is also a complete That doesn't manage all of this for you know, as I promised in the start of the video, I haven't shared some of the person expedience with the dog as well, So here we go. I've been talking about. Why Dark net and what is darkness. This is a very interesting and that Spacy question which people need to understand about Microsoft Dark Knight framework. Microsoft doc*ment Framework in public and it evolved. Ideas into about Microsoft Chartered framework. Let me help you the why dot was fairly needed what purpose it is a strongly in industry if you know about C or programming languages or even then basic financial of these two from our languages C users has include S p I or downs to perform and Jeff and the scanning functionality. Similarly C does is as soon type of programming running language with object to date framework edit and it uses dot these two languages are almost same they perform same type of functionality, but they have to just in type of some time environment they have two different set of libraries on together two different from two different management techniques and so on means if you have my specific type of application moving to owned it can using C or it can be told up using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with or interacting with two different runtime environment and do this and code credentials. Is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming running languages, which required two different core managers libraries and sometimes. So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages. Now as you you happen to have this basic and installed in your computer system and you have a paradigm time manage and the total window and it goes on and on and on the more language. If you bio in your computer system. Now wouldn't it be great if you just happen to have only one set a run time funds set of library very and one single and deal with programming languages. Credit so in session and what is net framework. It was July like two thousand when bill gates up period in a B d C with stands of process develop conference in our line of data where be that we have uploaded it now and we call it microsoft dot net framework like Microsoft dot net easily was named as n G w U S, which stands for next generation windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later around named it as startup. \n",

Then have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer which just sitting between your operating system and dot net compliant programming languages. So Microsoft framework is a software earlier layer which says the business studio view and operating system. It's supports many two running languages as a framework is supposed to do are supposed to provide common functionality across different type of application.

You can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint and start there and lost, but not the least Docker is also a complete That doesn't manage all of this for you know, as I promised in the start of the video, I haven't shared some of the person expedience with the dog as well, So here we go. I've been talking about. Why Dark net and what is darkness. This is a very interesting and that Spacy question which people need to understand about Microsoft Dark Knight framework. Microsoft doc*ment Framework in public and it evolved. Ideas into about Microsoft Chartered framework. Let me help you the why dot was fairly needed what purpose it is a strongly in industry if you know about C or programming languages or even then basic financial of these two from our languages C users has include S p I or downs to perform and Jeff and the scanning functionality. Similarly C does is as soon type of programming running language with object to date framework edit and it uses dot these two languages are almost same they perform same type of functionality, but they have to just in type of some time environment they have two different set of libraries on together two different from two different management techniques and so on means if you have my specific type of application moving to owned it can using C or it can be told up using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with or interacting with two different runtime environment and do this and code credentials. Is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming running languages, which required two different core managers libraries and sometimes. So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages. Now as you you happen to have this basic and installed in your computer system and you have a paradigm time manage and the total window and it goes on and on and on the more language. If you bio in your computer system. Now wouldn't it be great if you just happen to have only one set a run time funds set of library very and one single and deal with programming languages. Credit so in session and what is net framework. It was July like two thousand when bill gates up period in a B d C with stands of process develop conference in our line of data where be that we have uploaded it now and we call it microsoft dot net framework like Microsoft dot net easily was named as n G w U S, which stands for next generation windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later around named it as startup. \n",

      " Text:  the example of the guy is very simple. Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping. I remember the example. This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.  Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes. Maybe four search engine may be producing moving logger inside of them features. Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.  Hey, no problem at all. I'll give you a A.P.I. key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I. key works. So yes, that is it. This isn't This is your A.P.I.. Now, there's no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area. It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging. The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I. off Facebook and Google on. You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark. I'm not gonna put any satellite into the space. And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there. Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards. She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that's I can use that API that would be much more important. So varies all how and maybe tell the I'll try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language. You might want to initialize that feature. get everyone. Be sure Buck again with the video. And in this video we're gonna talk about Docker. After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you. And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me. So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed. The first and the only gold we'll be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem. Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem. So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve. \n",

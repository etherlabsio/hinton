      "This type of DBMs is rarely used nowadays is structured like a tree with notes representing records and branches representing fields.\n",

      "Now what is a data database we already know what data is, but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy.\n",
      "What is a database management system DBMs database management system or DBMs is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data.\n",
      "It also helps control access to the database by various users.\n",
      "Let is discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a dBMS to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data etcetera.\n",
      "Let is consider the Facebook.\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest example of all is Google search every time you use Google search you are using a system as machine learning system that core from understanding the text of your query to adjusting the results based on your first interests such as knowing which results to when searching for Java depending anyhow whether you are a copy expert or developer.\n",
      "Perhaps your both today machine learning immediate applications are already quite white ranging including recognition fraud detection and recommendation systems as well as texts each systems too being powerful capabilities can we apply to a wide range fields from and skin cancer detection to retail and of course in the form of self parking and self vehicles.\n",
      "It was not that long ago that want a company or product and machine learning in a offerings.\n",
      "He was considered novel now and my company is visiting to use machine learning and their products in some way it is rapidly becoming well an expect feature trust as we expect companies that have a website that works on your mobile device or perhaps I have a the day was come when it will be expected that our technology will be personalized and staple and self correcting as we use machine learning to make human tasks that are faster than before we can also look further into the future while machine learning can help us to test that we never could achieved on our own.\n",
      "It is not hard to take advantage of machine learning today.\n",
      "The Toy has gotten quite good all you need is data developers and a willingness to take the punch for our purposes.\n",
      "I sure the definition machine learning gestures five words using data to answer questions while would not use that a short answer for an profile exam.\n",
      "It serves a useful purpose for us asume in particular we can split the definition into two parts using data and ask for questions.\n",
      "This further brings the clasic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\n",
      "And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that is why the problem is occurring.\n",
      "Query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as sequel is actually this standard language for dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does not mean SQL cannot do things beyond on that in fact it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like oracle Ms SQL Sai etcetera use SQL SQL syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different and even proprietary SQL an example of an SQL statement selected star from members where age is greater than thirty DBMs stands for database management system.\n",
      "We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most widely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.\n",

      "Now if you want to understand a bit more about framework work.\n",
      "Then have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer which just sitting between your operating system and dot net compliant programming languages.\n",
      "So Microsoft framework is a software earlier layer which says the business studio view and operating system.\n",
      "It is supports many two running languages as a framework is supposed to do are supposed to provide common functionality across different type of application.\n",
      "It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisnts and a lot more.\n",
      "We can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of DBMS database management systems are not a new concept and as such has been first implemented in the nineteen sixties Charles docments integrated data store or d is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a aligned while usage and unexpected functional of databases have been increased immensely types of DBMs M s.\n",

      " Text:  everyone they share back again. Now, in this video, even talk about what is A.P.I. are also on this application. Programming Integration. Now, this is a very common Adam Bay you spent on. It is a problem in our society or a computer society. Begin zero f with people understand that some trick or not, we just wanted to be technically correct. So if you look up for the A.P.I. destination on any platform Wikipedia block, they are technically correct. That's one part, but they're not so much understandable. So in this video, we're going to make sure that you understand A.P.I. what is A.P.I.? And after watching this video, you never, ever watch any video on A.P.I. or block because you will be understanding each and every bit off idea. So let's get started. Let's talk about what is A.P.I.. Now go ahead, open up your favorite. Start changing and try to look up for What is it? Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here. A.P.I.. What is it? A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system. Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle. That means we don't get it. What disease Yet? The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I. will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point. Understand? Here's the problem. The people who are already using the A.P.I. I don't mean to understand. What is it? Yeah, because they know about it. But the people who don't understand the FBI, we need to target at people. You need to make sure that they understand. So let me give you a quick example, and I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation, bored very quickly. the example of the guy is very simple. Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping. I remember the example. This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.  Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes. Maybe four search engine may be producing moving logger inside of them features. Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.  Hey, no problem at all. I'll give you a A.P.I. key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I. key works. So yes, that is it. This isn't This is your A.P.I.. Now, there's no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area. It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging. The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I. off Facebook and Google on. You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark. I'm not gonna put any satellite into the space. And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there. Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards. She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that's I can use that API that would be much more important. So varies all how and maybe tell the I'll try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language. You might want to initialize that feature. get everyone. Be sure Buck again with the video. And in this video we're gonna talk about Docker. After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you. And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me. So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed. The first and the only gold we'll be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem. Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem. So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve. never, never, never develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time. Markers. Well, that problem is whenever you're designing a project, it was absolutely fine in your machine, the developer machine. But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody's else computer. Maybe your friends are maybe a manager. This computer. In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place. Although here we're talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum. Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net. Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly. Maybe the palace is a little bit different. All glitchy and solve these cases. That is a cla*sic example. When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place. It doesn't work like that. So the cla*sic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the cla*sic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check. And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.  dinner and these containers are the absolute heart off the Docker. These containers wrap up your entire code on these are absolutely portable. The portability is both absolute charm off the Docker. Now we can dig this container and bay where you're going to put this country that it's gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine. Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb. Well, the cla*sic example is, whenever you're learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging. I'm not talking about the GHB Paschal package. I'm talking about just the score, my a*s. Cuba. It's one of the most challenging thing. Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody's running Windows, Mac and violence. It's not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer. So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container. They're super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks. He's the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you're running from the networking information that you're running. And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something's in your code. So in order. Summarize. Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you. Number one thing. It's a client side application program. You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking.  \n",

The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I. off Facebook and Google on. You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark. I'm not gonna put any satellite into the space. And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there. Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards. She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that's I can use that API that would be much more important. So varies all how and maybe tell the I'll try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language. You might want to initialize that feature. get everyone. Be sure Buck again with the video. And in this video we're gonna talk about Docker. After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you. And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me. So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed. The first and the only gold we'll be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem. Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem. So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve. \n",

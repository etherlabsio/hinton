Just a few lines of code how you can deploy applications and then some kind of various thoughts on it along the way so let's get into it demystifying Docker. First thing we're going to do is we're going to compare Docker to vagrant or Docker to a virtual machine since this seems to be the hangout that I keep hearing from people. Okay, so I get vagrant but I don't get Docker. Well, that's because they're really different. Here's got a very visual people visual demonstration. What vagrant is I'm going to kind of show you real quickly vagrant for those you guys aren't familiar with it. And I'm going to show you how it's not really a fair comparison. So vagrant is the goal is to solve the problem of it works on my machine. It doesn't work on production or it works on my machine. It doesn't work on this other developers machine that happens because somewhere along the road you might be on a different operating system say your machine is a Mac or Windows machine and you're pushing it out to a Linux, you know server that alone could cause problems you might be running Wham form and on your It's a PHP application and these guys are actually running a full, you know, just native installation of an Apache stack or you have a different tool set that you're using then another developer. But any rate your environments are not the same so we solve that by spinning up a virtual machine in our computer. That's the exact same thing. We're going to be pushing to staging or production.

This cycle can happen many times. What development is done building the product gets thrown over the fence of tests where when problems are encountered. It bounces back to development and sometimes back to planning the same issues occur in the next few steps with lots of back stepping and doing over this can lead to length times and many months to several years in order to get a product out the door with scrum and implementation of agile. The process is broken. The smaller pieces first when you just not planning to get started with building the minimum feature set. We build what was planned next we test and review that small feature set and get it ready to ship. When that cycle is complete we end up with a potentially shippable product. This process usually occurs in a time period of one to three weeks. This is then repeated time and time again reducing the time from planning to development to testing each time through the planning process.

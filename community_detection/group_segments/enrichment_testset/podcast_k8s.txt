And so when I come in externally to any of these 52 or 53 via 10.0 dot 50.2: 1022 this is going to route me to my appropriate and points and I can go to these endpoints or worker nodes whether they have the Pod that I'm looking for or not. And so what's going to happen here is this is going to get installed in IP tables and regardless of which IP that I go to for a worker no perspective always get my endpoint service. So this is going to be distributed across our entire cluster and I can hit any of the worker node clusters inside of that. Next is my particular service that I want. And so that's how Channel connectivity happens as well. And so again a little recap here. We have kubernetes service from a cluster IP level a cluster IP where we can actually communicate East-West and then a kubernetes from a node Port another option. There would be load balancer where I can actually come in externally and access my kubernetes service and then for networking topology options, I can either do an overlay Network which provides some Simplicity when I'm standing up or scaling out clusters and then also So I can do a flat routed Network where I'm maintaining the routes of the node Network inside of my physical Network on so on so forth. And so those are basically the kubernetes networking options that we see today. Thank you. ",

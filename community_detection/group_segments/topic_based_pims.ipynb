We are picking up in the section 4 of the paper starting with how to derive a merge function for An arbitrary data type. Okay. Hey Colin.

      "So if we are all on the same lines, but for the entity graph, so are we going to how do we do?\n",
      "So the Lambda service would be populating the Digraph is it?\n",
      "And I found the Lambda service can just populate a network.\n",
      "It is object on the or it can just take it as a Json object, which is compatible for DeGraff.\n",
      "I will try to find out some data from use late.\n",
      "They dubbed as the videos which are your brothers?\n",
      "Then maybe we should not we should not worry about it right now because I think language construction is actually important because we are going by grammar.\n",
      "Rules There Is No Escape for that.\n",
      "And directed digest so the guy time focusing only on the subject is within the subject within the sentence.\n",
      "So the constant quality forward I was taking its back.\n",
      "Speakers will meeting which has been used because those are better quality and Is there a again I was able to find some false negatives but generally enin speakers the sponsor quality is bad.\n",
      "You can make make out that it is an action item, but the transcripts were so bad that that is literally if you read the sentence it is it is it is not connected transfer transcripts.\n",
      "I think like we we can we can have it right as Network X object the ETL code.\n",
      "Is there any way so you can convert XnumberXD graph kind of data and populate to our AGP workstation so that we can directly use the graph fairies instead of neck?\n",
      "Then the transition will not be problematic, right?\n",
      "So it is like so now we have like forever a persistent Network X pickle.\n",
      "It is an SXnumberX to keep its in SXnumberX and then we keep upright a replacing that after every meal.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "So the search engine so Jen comparison parties working finals faster than just cosine work dries cosine similarity.\n",
      "Okay, the result is not conclusive because of skewed is to data.\n",
      "Yeah, so now right now I am not advocating any feature vectors or anything.\n",
      "So the way I am testing it right now is so say in summary we get a highlight right so that the set of keywords in those in that highlight will be the query will be against which we want to check what other similar works.\n",
      "And the complete list of similar words comes from the D graph query for all the users.\n",
      "We need to do similarity measure.\n",
      "The problem is when I checked on the staging to data the drawer there were XnumberX users with key phrases and are they around five or six of them had at least XnumberX key phrases as\n",
      "So Sunday on the recommended Roger Fisher any observation because last time you wanted to share some you.\n",
      "This we had if we had a discussion which would include site because the way you are getting the whatever I do not I vaguely remember but the way of aggregation there was conflict whether it works or not works.\n",
      "So the way I was doing it initially was a so I was using like a proximate search kind of thing which reduces such things initially.\n",
      "So if I agree at all the key phrases of the users, then it comes out to be around like XnumberX,XnumberX XnumberX,XnumberX.\n",
      "The next video is so space to XnumberX,XnumberX or XnumberX,XnumberX something based on threshold and then from like proper cosine similarity match.\n",
      "Yeah, when it shows the top three users.\n",
      "So those top three are based on the approximate such thing.\n",
      "Then I take the key phases of all these top three users and then make a like proper comparison.\n",
      "Okay, and then I show you related keywords, but\n",
      "Yeah here in the yes.\n",
      "It is possible that it could be because of the program.\n",
      "Then it may be like a mix playlist or then it would take better after publication.\n",
      "It has been happening on but if it happens and it would say that resources healthy orders.\n",
      "It will just put that it is unhealthy and we have chicken.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "No, I think that should happen independent of the service if it happens.\n",
      "It should happen at the place where which is calling the services stuff within the service.\n",
      "Do we where do we put this because currently this has know what you call applications right?\n",
      "So it is only the back end job.\n",
      "But it right later click compute graph where in we do not we do not capture any meeting level information that can be quite easy because you never captured meeting meeting drafts you you know the text so it can be easily carried.\n",
      "So to keep it simple we can have the entity entity counter entity to entity relationship based on the cooccurrence window.\n",
      "So this entity graph should be basically populating the meeting transcripts, right?\n",
      "So then say if we have it as a separate service it can listen to this add segments topic and it will keep getting meeting transcript segments.\n",
      "And whenever you get segments can call the entity extraction Lambda identities for that segment and do the population.\n",
      "Is that it is a it is a single graph.\n",
      "Apparently that means you do not have a meeting here will graph.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "I am just trying to lose sleep understand.\n",
      "What are the is there some way to remove noises in the whole sentence?\n",
      "Yeah, can we pinpoint free to some ideal comparison between two sentences instead of the whole sentence level features?\n",
      "Okay, that is a valid thing.\n",
      "So if you if you beat right key phrase comparison, but at least for me did not work out.\n",
      "Well, that means take only the key phrases and then try to compare it in make any difference.\n",
      "It is as nice idea sentence comparison.\n",
      "It is not about if a similarity but but instead of trying to compare the whole sentence for to form the cosine distance between them.\n",
      "Is there a better way like one obvious way is to do the entity comparison.\n",
      "Augmenting the data comparison is wanting to when there is no entity.\n",
      "How do you compare to keep two sentences?\n",
      "So it is a competitor.\n",
      "It is even complimenting the whole sentence ability features or is that some proving talk about?\n",
      "I thought we could use the refresh similarity as a start where the key phrase is given as it is as it takes feature, not the sentence.\n",
      "It is a part of\n",
      "And you query against the same thing every key phrase on its own without any sentence context.\n",
      "Okay, that seems to be working pretty decent.\n",
      "So for a query like container I get Ford is application Ford is been cubelet VM instance and right now\n",

      "What if we what if we could embed All the known works and then and then and then what do we do?\n",
      "Can we use that can use that information?\n",
      "Oh again, it is difficult.\n",
      "So if we can find a subset assume that it is been pointing to some kind of a common pattern in all those in multiple cases then instead of trying to find a hundred sentences sentences for particular intervening.\n",
      "We can take the pattern of subsets for one single sentence itself.\n",
      "But let us assume that for two entities effect.\n",
      "If you can rank the features, but you cannot subset the pages as soon as the subset the features out of XnumberX you lose the ability to compare because you will always compare you have to compare against those feature in this.\n",
      "You mean when you say set of features, are you talking about sentence tree?\n",
      "That is a subset of XnumberX features.\n",
      "That is the whole you whole line of experimentation.\n",
      "I think subsetting the feature space.\n",
      "Maybe we can we can start that and then see what is this baguette as a parallel with this is trying to bring it into the current means to\n",
      "But what you are talking about the sentence the sentence comparison do we do you have any conflicting observations?\n",
      "So then what do you expect about about those things?\n",
      "Because when you are talking about the verbs and phrases, right?\n",
      "So is it a good idea for us to learn the context like how we are learning the context of entities you think it is a good idea to learn the context of so, that is what this is.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "From what I have seen I also did the number of sentences check and there is not a correlation between number of sentences and relation to the entity.\n",
      "So if you have one thing it is not necessary that there is not any correlation like if I take two entities, yeah, if I take two entities, even if they have like very few sentences in common, they may still get a higher score than two.\n",
      "Entities with like many more sentences in common.\n",
      "So the basic thing is if suppose you encounter an entity in a sentence if the sentence has more than one new entity in a then you are essentially comparing the same sentence for both entities like yeah, hence it is bad.\n",
      "So I thought in that case continued use the query has like a combination of both as in cosine similarity of the entity as it is.\n",
      "Plus like the center said it is a part of in case of similar entity.\n",
      "Okay, and then and then I asked you we were discussing last Fred airport one more thing great.\n",
      "But what is the effective number of sentences in the contribution first contribution of that?\n",
      "So let us try to address the cases where you have one unknown entity in a meeting.\n",
      "Then we will in a single occurrence.\n",
      "Maybe that is that is deviation.\n",
      "Let is let us hope that is like a corner case.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Okay already has a right.\n",
      "We just we can do the Top Line Is It On\n",
      "No, we can we can we can do it offline post call.\n",
      "But but we have we have like the data structure.\n",
      "Let is say if you have captured all the entities in a graph.\n",
      "So we can continue the way we are capturing it right now like Network X based or anything.\n",
      "Okay, and maybe for like few meeting if it is if you are capturing live then we can like Observer like couple of meetings and it is easy to convert from Network X XnumberXD graphs.\n",
      "Okay, or any other kind of need that is not a problem.\n",
      "So, how do you think of the use cases that we might need of\n",
      "Yeah, if it is, like for mind representation of any kind of thing, then we should be capturing all this information so later it is up to us.\n",
      "We can control which which one we want to keep it or remove but it is better if we think from now self what all things we might use it for and capture all of them.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "So now you have one extreme where you did not put any constraint on the probability of masking a noun phrase later ulis.\n",
      "I mean the next model that you are going to try to lessen our probability of masking a noun phrase that will fall in line with approximately because you cannot definitely definitive about it because you are doing the phrase level so you will approximately make it close to the bird trading strategy and then try to converse case walk.\n",
      "And you will not you will end up it can also it may be possible that your current approach itself.\n",
      "And this noun phrase thing?\n",
      "All we are trying to do is we are trying to force the model to to to rely on noun phrases.\n",
      "So we will get a model that focuses on noun phrase instead of the whole.\n",
      "So all the parts tags.\n",
      "That I do not know if it is good.\n",
      "I am just saying I am just telling all these things as they are, you know is good.\n",
      "If it is giving different results or by the results that are biased towards the front raises.\n",
      "Then we might want to use that model beyond that.\n",
      "I do not see anything any take away from this experiment.\n",
      "If you consider masking or non faces all the time will not that be like the most aggressive form of this approach?\n",
      "So we have one active.\n",
      "So from that, I remember I sent you this collection of tokens and how they shifted in bird compared to GPT and like they are very similar.\n",
      "So I think we can keep this in this one end and then see how it works.\n",
      "By killing that MLM thing and oh, yeah.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Yeah, so in order to add more contacts between the aggregated sentence features, which works very well.\n",
      "The issue now is the fact that if you have entity that has never been seen by the model before then you cannot have a sentence that it is a part of because that would because we do not have a sentence now we\n",
      "I thought that is what so I also checked the comparison between should we take the sentence as a query or should we take the entity as the query so the temple thought process here is that since it has learned to decent representation for the entity.\n",
      "We can take the entity itself and then get the similar sentence representation through the aggregated ones or take the sentence itself.\n",
      "This is not much difference between the two things where the query is different.\n",
      "However, thinking of it like from a normal standpoint what this is.\n",
      "The query has to be the whole sentence.\n",
      "It cannot be the single entity because\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Maybe it should not be part of an existing service.\n",
      "I because existing Services if they are if they are like a frontend reflection jobs like pimp some reason we do not want to mess up with your yeah, okay.\n",
      "Under the separation keep to keep it simple.\n",
      "If you want to you want to be optimal about the computation.\n",
      "Then we have to think of the right spot in the key phrases section service on where it should be happening because rest of the pre or post processing things are very negligible here because their sentence level in you are just aggregating dictionary of something and then they are not ankle.\n",
      "They are not bottleneck tasks.\n",
      "So how different is it for the O of the Lambda to be waiting for that?\n",
      "And then as soon as it gets the segment it just it just extracts the key phrase the entities and then populate the graph and then and then we there am I missing something.\n",
      "You want to optimize competition one one thing we can do is keep her service when it calls entity and it gets entities in the key phrase service can position our stop it.\n",
      "And so this this entity graph service will be listening to that topic and so it will basically get segment and entities it is no call for that.\n",
      "Some disconnect it is not about whether we do it this way or not.\n",
      "But small disconnect for me is what if I am big Dumbo what all these things and then I do the same way every time as if for the summary service also, we get all the segments like as soon as the segment is generated.\n",
      "Dont you think we should have this as Lambda or or because it is graph population.\n",
      "We do not want it to be a lamp.\n",
      "I have got that gets populated during which service should be accurately or should the platform.\n",
      "Victor should the platforms then the segment to this Louis has feel like every other service.\n",
      "So like from the publish this ad underscore segments topic is Caprice is just listening to it.\n",
      "Then it can get the segments automatically.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Youre masking lot of context.\n",
      "Maybe you should reduce the just try to align with the XnumberX and fry.\n",
      "Well example and see how many noun phrase becoming and if they are more than XnumberX percent.\n",
      "It would be hard visual like like a mask only you have to do some observations based thresholding on that and then mask only those with the with like maybe XnumberX probability Mass call the not Damascus from Paris.\n",
      "Yeah, that is what so if that is if that model is performing way better than what we have right now.\n",
      "It is respect to sentencing levity.\n",
      "So it means that the entity should be given very much high priority over others in a particular sentence.\n",
      "So what is the major phrase or major?\n",
      "Major phrase in a sentence which is influencing default feature.\n",
      "Yeah that says the normal model.\n",
      "So if you choose to mask if noun presence and then try to learn a model and then if we see some different results.\n",
      "When you get you get something but you do not know what to do about it.\n",
      "What if what if you think things have two key phrases?\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "So the communities we serve will we do not have anything like it is already in production.\n",
      "So we just need to keep a watch on there.\n",
      "And we will be discussing about possible improvements or I mean the cases where we should look at this morning.\n",
      "So so we keep waiting will make the observation base will as we get more calls and we will see where it is working out and we should look at it.\n",
      "Try hittin it is just to be sure.\n",
      "I mean, I just he is done it again plus saying happened with that Curative on all sides.\n",
      "I did not get the entities earlier, but now I got I do not know it just to look at it.\n",
      "Was open yeah, so so so by doing this we are not invoking the entity extraction Lambda twice.\n",
      "Here so only the Standalone graph population service.\n",
      "So, do you are you using the current four chapters?\n",
      "Also you are using the entity extraction service right here.\n",
      "Why should we invoke another Lambda?\n",
      "Why cannot you do all the population looted be bought?\n",
      "Yeah, so maybe it is not it is that is fine.\n",
      "So this for definitely be better than space at least because that is the only Baseline we have.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "But as I would just put a document just to be just to make sure that I am just listing out everything which I think needs Improvement.\n",
      "So again before too fi, oh the whole bunch of beautiful platinum singles.\n",
      "For example, like if you have like two or three calls where they man, very targeted.\n",
      "What are the likely top concerns which we might get we always go because it is specific set of calls.\n",
      "So for example, like if you push some ice in mind or SE model to production and then what it does is like because there is a new push to the GitHub.\n",
      "Then it would automatically have a gift of fashion which could trigger a script which would internally call Lambda.\n",
      "So with this land ourselves would get requests.\n",
      "Like what was what was the kind of the model or particular term starting from servers?\n",
      "We get some wine service been what model online that it needs to chill.\n",
      "And then it would pull the model of mine from bsXnumberX then have some validations from behind planet and then push back to school.\n",
      "Okay, actually, we also wanted to talk about that Master develop right?\n",
      "I know these are the same.\n",
      "Yeah, we thought we will do it this week.\n",
      "Okay on that Lambda anything.\n",
      "So that the main reason was we were initially having some either because all the plumbing right now is only is three days away.\n",
      "We just copy some mindset or model side and push it there.\n",
      "Yeah, so it is easy to lose track of where we are copying or pasting it.\n",
      "So and it is not like a staging to environment directly push to production it still copypasting substrates, including multiple testing to production.\n",
      "So even there some problem might occur.\n",
      "So I just wanted to make sure that every time you push in just six with some basic validation scheme whether people to the right path.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Fine actually, so we are discussing this morning about how to go about filtration.\n",
      "That means we are trying to find out if they are to two places to optimize that action items.\n",
      "Right one is the model LXnumberX at the post processing level.\n",
      "So the model we are just using the XnumberX conference threshold.\n",
      "I think that is fine for now the biggest One potential Improvement is that even your back?\n",
      "So one potential Improvement is to find out the leakage is where in you you have you have confidence for a an action item?\n",
      "But it just got just got out because there is now there is the subject is not really qualitative.\n",
      "So for that currently again again under that we have we are addressing only the sentences that are having selfcontained subjects, right?\n",
      "So so if they are not if they are referring to prop up pronouns and we are just filtering out so that is one one candidate for improvement.\n",
      "So which which I think show em should be working on and then and then the other other one is there is there is a there is a The sentence is selfcontained.\n",
      "So we just need to find out the Mist Outpost.\n",
      "I mean the postprocessing steps that are causing this and then see how you can fix that.\n",
      "like so and on the model part, we have not I do not think we need anything right now to I think the current model is suffice.\n",
      "It is giving enough false positives and true positive.\n",
      "So, so it is all about reducing the false positives and bye.\n",
      "So I started testing GPT is ability to capture either data along with SE data by combining the data sets and then painting the model.\n",
      "So we found that training with a combination of two plus one second sentences in the IROC manner allowed it to capture context as update some of the tokens but this order to capture context or an entity level.\n",
      "Whereas as a new directly Feed The Entity and you get it.\n",
      "A decent enough representation this I doublechecked by comparing giving an entity and taking the most similar entity.\n",
      "So this works well for the most part but in terms of actual sentence to sentence comparisons, it does not make that much of a difference whether we use the in incremental approach or this approach.\n",
      "So the only place actually see a difference is in this entities comparison.\n",
      "So that is something we want to take a look at.\n",
      "yeah, I think we discussed almost like both their action items and communities, but but you can just so sugarman is action template so Can we?\n",
      "Okay, just give it to everyone update everyone.\n",
      "Both in both cases the combined data sets one performs better than that one.\n",
      "But in terms of like little NSP comparisons is not much difference.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "so to simplify for these aggregated sentences, right?\n",
      "There are set of features which are repeating throughout these sentences.\n",
      "Okay now coming back to what what SRI was pointing about comparing two sentences.\n",
      "Like like if entities it has improved it should also improve on the gel in a totally unrelated sentences.\n",
      "That need not be true because if you are talking about contexts, then you are not only talking about Docker and kubernetes are also talking about a verb like context like testing and deployment right which does not really account for the end piece itself.\n",
      "So in that case the two models May differ because one is based on, you know, two plus one and neither has more context with four plus one sentences.\n",
      "But with so when we are doing all these aggregation of sentences, right?\n",
      "So that means that all these entities features get either added up or get zoomed in while other public testing these kind of phrases or words get Lift Away.\n",
      "I mean if you could do that, we could we could do that to find the most similar entities, right?\n",
      "See it is this is a factual.\n",
      "This is lack of action information because there is a new entity and then you do not have enough context of where it can be used except the current sentence.\n",
      "So what I was trying to say is like you have a hundred sentences of XnumberX sentences, you know that there are some particular entities for example, like Docker which is kept on beating in all the hundred sentences.\n",
      "So now we take the aggregated feature Vector for this entity.\n",
      "Yes, not all these sentences right now.\n",
      "If you get a new entity something called as an eternal then we do not have some repeated understand sentences where the heat is being presented.\n",
      "So, but if we are able to find the dominating feature vector Our official of features which would be equal to using that same word ether in hundreds and Cancers.\n",
      "So instead of aggregating is it possible to select particular set of features for us, which is dominating.\n",
      "For that sentence like instead of like if you create a new sentence, which has a new NPP somehow we should be able to reproduce it as if it is already present in the hole if it already does not like in XnumberX to XnumberX sentences.\n",
      "After removing overlapping groups\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Anyway, I think both of these tests.\n",
      "So one was a literal string comparison of entities as well as the aggregated sentences.\n",
      "So while comparing these two methods are found that the aggregated sentences work better because JP has a tendency to select more similar words that start with the same letter.\n",
      "So ether it will sort of pick all tokens that are there in its reputation that start Withey similarly for Docker and stuff, yeah\n",
      "Water level Thing by but there is no alphabet level.\n",
      "It is not it is not the alphabet level.\n",
      "Identity similarity if you are talking about literal entity similarity, which means the string of the entity.\n",
      "I am not sure if that is the right right way to answer your question.\n",
      "But if you do not know what the sentence well, maybe yes, I mean that the in DC Community feature is nothing but the aggregation of all the sentences that we that it is part of\n",
      "Because when it is up when it updates a language model, it updates on a token level not on a word level.\n",
      "So if you get Docker you will get the and cker.\n",
      "Yeah, so it will also pick words that have Bo in it like the okay.\n",
      "I am choosing the latter.\n",
      "I am testing testing both models using this entity to similarity because that is something that came up recently as a requirement for the moderate.\n",
      "So trying to use that as a test to see whether okay, you know, the engineering model is able to capture so\n",
      "Anyway, the is that good enough test for the model?\n",
      "Oh, yeah over literally percent similarity think that we are that we have always been doing.\n",
      "Yeah, that is what sentence ability wise.\n",
      "There is not too much difference between the old method and the new method is what I am trying to say is I am sorry.\n",
      "But there is no guarantee that if you okay then then you have to isolate the validation.\n",
      "You have to take the sentences with only with the entities and then compare that is one thing but that does not give you the view for the other one where you do not have an entity as learned by the bottle.\n",
      "I think we have to be specific the right when we talk about in detail.\n",
      "We had talked about the entities that are learned by the that are inferred by The Board model that has been trained.\n",
      "After removing overlapping groups\n",

      "Some disconnect it is not about whether we do it this way or not.\n",

      "It is respect to sentencing levity.\n",

      "So with this land ourselves would get requests.\n",

      "We get some wine service been what model online that it needs to chill.\n",

      "Yeah, we thought we will do it this week.\n",
      "Okay on that Lambda anything.\n",

      "We just copy some mindset or model side and push it there.\n",
      "Yeah, so it is easy to lose track of where we are copying or pasting it.\n",

      "Right one is the model LXnumberX at the post processing level.\n",
      "So the model we are just using the XnumberX conference threshold.\n",
      "I think that is fine for now the biggest One potential Improvement is that even your back?\n",
      "So one potential Improvement is to find out the leakage is where in you you have you have confidence for a an action item?\n",
      "But it just got just got out because there is now there is the subject is not really qualitative.\n",
      "So for that currently again again under that we have we are addressing only the sentences that are having selfcontained subjects, right?\n",
      "So so if they are not if they are referring to prop up pronouns and we are just filtering out so that is one one candidate for improvement.\n",
      "So which which I think show em should be working on and then and then the other other one is there is there is a there is a The sentence is selfcontained.\n",
      "So we just need to find out the Mist Outpost.\n",
      "I mean the postprocessing steps that are causing this and then see how you can fix that.\n",
      "like so and on the model part, we have not I do not think we need anything right now to I think the current model is suffice.\n",
      "It is giving enough false positives and true positive.\n",
      "So, so it is all about reducing the false positives and bye.\n",
      "So I started testing GPT is ability to capture either data along with SE data by combining the data sets and then painting the model.\n",
      "So we found that training with a combination of two plus one second sentences in the IROC manner allowed it to capture context as update some of the tokens but this order to capture context or an entity level.\n",
      "Whereas as a new directly Feed The Entity and you get it.\n",
      "A decent enough representation this I doublechecked by comparing giving an entity and taking the most similar entity.\n",
      "So this works well for the most part but in terms of actual sentence to sentence comparisons, it does not make that much of a difference whether we use the in incremental approach or this approach.\n",
      "So the only place actually see a difference is in this entities comparison.\n",
      "So that is something we want to take a look at.\n",
      "yeah, I think we discussed almost like both their action items and communities, but but you can just so sugarman is action template so Can we?\n",
      "Okay, just give it to everyone update everyone.\n",
      "Both in both cases the combined data sets one performs better than that one.\n",
      "But in terms of like little NSP comparisons is not much difference.\n",
      "After removing overlapping groups\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "so to simplify for these aggregated sentences, right?\n",
      "There are set of features which are repeating throughout these sentences.\n",
      "Okay now coming back to what what SRI was pointing about comparing two sentences.\n",
      "Like like if entities it has improved it should also improve on the gel in a totally unrelated sentences.\n",
      "That need not be true because if you are talking about contexts, then you are not only talking about Docker and kubernetes are also talking about a verb like context like testing and deployment right which does not really account for the end piece itself.\n",
      "So in that case the two models May differ because one is based on, you know, two plus one and neither has more context with four plus one sentences.\n",
      "But with so when we are doing all these aggregation of sentences, right?\n",
      "So that means that all these entities features get either added up or get zoomed in while other public testing these kind of phrases or words get Lift Away.\n",
      "I mean if you could do that, we could we could do that to find the most similar entities, right?\n",
      "See it is this is a factual.\n",
      "This is lack of action information because there is a new entity and then you do not have enough context of where it can be used except the current sentence.\n",
      "So what I was trying to say is like you have a hundred sentences of XnumberX sentences, you know that there are some particular entities for example, like Docker which is kept on beating in all the hundred sentences.\n",
      "So now we take the aggregated feature Vector for this entity.\n",
      "Yes, not all these sentences right now.\n",
      "If you get a new entity something called as an eternal then we do not have some repeated understand sentences where the heat is being presented.\n",
      "So, but if we are able to find the dominating feature vector Our official of features which would be equal to using that same word ether in hundreds and Cancers.\n",
      "So instead of aggregating is it possible to select particular set of features for us, which is dominating.\n",
      "For that sentence like instead of like if you create a new sentence, which has a new NPP somehow we should be able to reproduce it as if it is already present in the hole if it already does not like in XnumberX to XnumberX sentences.\n",
      "Checking Timerange --------------\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "I am choosing the latter.\n",
      "I am testing testing both models using this entity to similarity because that is something that came up recently as a requirement for the moderate.\n",
      "So trying to use that as a test to see whether okay, you know, the engineering model is able to capture so\n",
      "Anyway, the is that good enough test for the model?\n",
      "Oh, yeah over literally percent similarity think that we are that we have always been doing.\n",
      "Yeah, that is what sentence ability wise.\n",
      "There is not too much difference between the old method and the new method is what I am trying to say is I am sorry.\n",
      "But there is no guarantee that if you okay then then you have to isolate the validation.\n",
      "You have to take the sentences with only with the entities and then compare that is one thing but that does not give you the view for the other one where you do not have an entity as learned by the bottle.\n",
      "We had talked about the entities that are learned by the that are inferred by The Board model that has been trained.\n",
      "I think we have to be specific the right when we talk about in detail.\n",
      "But if you do not know what the sentence well, maybe yes, I mean that the in DC Community feature is nothing but the aggregation of all the sentences that we that it is part of\n",
      "Identity similarity if you are talking about literal entity similarity, which means the string of the entity.\n",
      "I am not sure if that is the right right way to answer your question.\n",
      "Anyway, I think both of these tests.\n",
      "So while comparing these two methods are found that the aggregated sentences work better because JP has a tendency to select more similar words that start with the same letter.\n",
      "So one was a literal string comparison of entities as well as the aggregated sentences.\n",
      "So ether it will sort of pick all tokens that are there in its reputation that start Withey similarly for Docker and stuff, yeah\n",
      "Water level Thing by but there is no alphabet level.\n",
      "It is not it is not the alphabet level.\n",
      "Because when it is up when it updates a language model, it updates on a token level not on a word level.\n",
      "Yeah, so it will also pick words that have Bo in it like the okay.\n",
      "So if you get Docker you will get the and cker.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "So once I have it in the graph, then I will run it again and check how it looks for production.\n",
      "Only I like transformed all the production data and now I am ready to decaf.\n",
      "Yeah, it is a good day.\n",
      "So this one Whatever result is gives is like the most basic way of getting the users.\n",
      "Yeah, the idea is like this.\n",
      "Yeah, so like as opposed to purchasing it would be ideal to just give them like related keywords should be related entities.\n",
      "Yeah, if not entities then at least noun phrase.\n",
      "So it is only Computing feature vectors and doing approximate match.\n",
      "So it is just a that the data are stored it as Jason.\n",
      "Yeah, they are not directly querying DeGraff when I did it on staging silly talk because we do not have DeGraff instance.\n",
      "So the Lambda service would be populating the Digraph is it?\n",
      "So if we are all on the same lines, but for the entity graph, so are we going to how do we do?\n",
      "It is object on the or it can just take it as a Json object, which is compatible for DeGraff.\n",
      "And I found the Lambda service can just populate a network.\n",
      "Then the transition will not be problematic, right?\n",
      "So it is like so now we have like forever a persistent Network X pickle.\n",
      "It is an SXnumberX to keep its in SXnumberX and then we keep upright a replacing that after every meal.\n",
      "Is there any way so you can convert XnumberXD graph kind of data and populate to our AGP workstation so that we can directly use the graph fairies instead of neck?\n",
      "I think like we we can we can have it right as Network X object the ETL code.\n",
      "And directed digest so the guy time focusing only on the subject is within the subject within the sentence.\n",
      "So the constant quality forward I was taking its back.\n",
      "You can make make out that it is an action item, but the transcripts were so bad that that is literally if you read the sentence it is it is it is not connected transfer transcripts.\n",
      "Speakers will meeting which has been used because those are better quality and Is there a again I was able to find some false negatives but generally enin speakers the sponsor quality is bad.\n",
      "Rules There Is No Escape for that.\n",
      "Then maybe we should not we should not worry about it right now because I think language construction is actually important because we are going by grammar.\n",
      "They dubbed as the videos which are your brothers?\n",
      "I will try to find out some data from use late.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "It will just put that it is unhealthy and we have chicken.\n",
      "Then it may be like a mix playlist or then it would take better after publication.\n",
      "It has been happening on but if it happens and it would say that resources healthy orders.\n",
      "Yeah here in the yes.\n",
      "It is possible that it could be because of the program.\n",
      "So Sunday on the recommended Roger Fisher any observation because last time you wanted to share some you.\n",
      "This we had if we had a discussion which would include site because the way you are getting the whatever I do not I vaguely remember but the way of aggregation there was conflict whether it works or not works.\n",
      "Yeah, so now right now I am not advocating any feature vectors or anything.\n",
      "And the complete list of similar words comes from the D graph query for all the users.\n",
      "So the way I am testing it right now is so say in summary we get a highlight right so that the set of keywords in those in that highlight will be the query will be against which we want to check what other similar works.\n",
      "The problem is when I checked on the staging to data the drawer there were XnumberX users with key phrases and are they around five or six of them had at least XnumberX key phrases as\n",
      "We need to do similarity measure.\n",
      "So those top three are based on the approximate such thing.\n",
      "Okay, and then I show you related keywords, but\n",
      "The next video is so space to XnumberX,XnumberX or XnumberX,XnumberX something based on threshold and then from like proper cosine similarity match.\n",
      "So the way I was doing it initially was a so I was using like a proximate search kind of thing which reduces such things initially.\n",
      "Yeah, when it shows the top three users.\n",
      "So if I agree at all the key phrases of the users, then it comes out to be around like XnumberX,XnumberX XnumberX,XnumberX.\n",
      "Then I take the key phases of all these top three users and then make a like proper comparison.\n",
      "Okay, the result is not conclusive because of skewed is to data.\n",
      "So the search engine so Jen comparison parties working finals faster than just cosine work dries cosine similarity.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "But it right later click compute graph where in we do not we do not capture any meeting level information that can be quite easy because you never captured meeting meeting drafts you you know the text so it can be easily carried.\n",
      "So to keep it simple we can have the entity entity counter entity to entity relationship based on the cooccurrence window.\n",
      "It should happen at the place where which is calling the services stuff within the service.\n",
      "No, I think that should happen independent of the service if it happens.\n",
      "Do we where do we put this because currently this has know what you call applications right?\n",
      "So it is only the back end job.\n",
      "So this entity graph should be basically populating the meeting transcripts, right?\n",
      "So then say if we have it as a separate service it can listen to this add segments topic and it will keep getting meeting transcript segments.\n",
      "And whenever you get segments can call the entity extraction Lambda identities for that segment and do the population.\n",
      "Is that it is a it is a single graph.\n",
      "Apparently that means you do not have a meeting here will graph.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "What are the is there some way to remove noises in the whole sentence?\n",
      "Yeah, can we pinpoint free to some ideal comparison between two sentences instead of the whole sentence level features?\n",
      "I am just trying to lose sleep understand.\n",
      "Well, that means take only the key phrases and then try to compare it in make any difference.\n",
      "It is as nice idea sentence comparison.\n",
      "Okay, that is a valid thing.\n",
      "So if you if you beat right key phrase comparison, but at least for me did not work out.\n",
      "It is not about if a similarity but but instead of trying to compare the whole sentence for to form the cosine distance between them.\n",
      "How do you compare to keep two sentences?\n",
      "Augmenting the data comparison is wanting to when there is no entity.\n",
      "Is there a better way like one obvious way is to do the entity comparison.\n",
      "It is a part of\n",
      "I thought we could use the refresh similarity as a start where the key phrase is given as it is as it takes feature, not the sentence.\n",
      "And you query against the same thing every key phrase on its own without any sentence context.\n",
      "So for a query like container I get Ford is application Ford is been cubelet VM instance and right now\n",
      "Okay, that seems to be working pretty decent.\n",
      "So it is a competitor.\n",
      "It is even complimenting the whole sentence ability features or is that some proving talk about?\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "That is a subset of XnumberX features.\n",
      "You mean when you say set of features, are you talking about sentence tree?\n",
      "So if we can find a subset assume that it is been pointing to some kind of a common pattern in all those in multiple cases then instead of trying to find a hundred sentences sentences for particular intervening.\n",
      "We can take the pattern of subsets for one single sentence itself.\n",
      "If you can rank the features, but you cannot subset the pages as soon as the subset the features out of XnumberX you lose the ability to compare because you will always compare you have to compare against those feature in this.\n",
      "But let us assume that for two entities effect.\n",
      "I think subsetting the feature space.\n",
      "Maybe we can we can start that and then see what is this baguette as a parallel with this is trying to bring it into the current means to\n",
      "That is the whole you whole line of experimentation.\n",
      "Because when you are talking about the verbs and phrases, right?\n",
      "But what you are talking about the sentence the sentence comparison do we do you have any conflicting observations?\n",
      "So then what do you expect about about those things?\n",
      "So is it a good idea for us to learn the context like how we are learning the context of entities you think it is a good idea to learn the context of so, that is what this is.\n",
      "I do not know it is difficult to anticipate but it is very easy to experiment.\n",
      "Can we use that can use that information?\n",
      "What if we what if we could embed All the known works and then and then and then what do we do?\n",
      "Music experiment I mean expectations.\n",
      "Oh again, it is difficult.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Okay, and then and then I asked you we were discussing last Fred airport one more thing great.\n",
      "But what is the effective number of sentences in the contribution first contribution of that?\n",
      "Entities with like many more sentences in common.\n",
      "So if you have one thing it is not necessary that there is not any correlation like if I take two entities, yeah, if I take two entities, even if they have like very few sentences in common, they may still get a higher score than two.\n",
      "From what I have seen I also did the number of sentences check and there is not a correlation between number of sentences and relation to the entity.\n",
      "So I thought in that case continued use the query has like a combination of both as in cosine similarity of the entity as it is.\n",
      "So the basic thing is if suppose you encounter an entity in a sentence if the sentence has more than one new entity in a then you are essentially comparing the same sentence for both entities like yeah, hence it is bad.\n",
      "Plus like the center said it is a part of in case of similar entity.\n",
      "So let us try to address the cases where you have one unknown entity in a meeting.\n",
      "Then we will in a single occurrence.\n",
      "Let is let us hope that is like a corner case.\n",
      "Maybe that is that is deviation.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Okay already has a right.\n",
      "We just we can do the Top Line Is It On\n",
      "No, we can we can we can do it offline post call.\n",
      "Let is say if you have captured all the entities in a graph.\n",
      "But but we have we have like the data structure.\n",
      "So, how do you think of the use cases that we might need of\n",
      "Okay, or any other kind of need that is not a problem.\n",
      "So we can continue the way we are capturing it right now like Network X based or anything.\n",
      "Okay, and maybe for like few meeting if it is if you are capturing live then we can like Observer like couple of meetings and it is easy to convert from Network X XnumberXD graphs.\n",
      "We can control which which one we want to keep it or remove but it is better if we think from now self what all things we might use it for and capture all of them.\n",
      "Yeah, if it is, like for mind representation of any kind of thing, then we should be capturing all this information so later it is up to us.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Then we might want to use that model beyond that.\n",
      "If it is giving different results or by the results that are biased towards the front raises.\n",
      "I do not see anything any take away from this experiment.\n",
      "And this noun phrase thing?\n",
      "So all the parts tags.\n",
      "So we will get a model that focuses on noun phrase instead of the whole.\n",
      "All we are trying to do is we are trying to force the model to to to rely on noun phrases.\n",
      "I am just saying I am just telling all these things as they are, you know is good.\n",
      "That I do not know if it is good.\n",
      "If you consider masking or non faces all the time will not that be like the most aggressive form of this approach?\n",
      "So I think we can keep this in this one end and then see how it works.\n",
      "So from that, I remember I sent you this collection of tokens and how they shifted in bird compared to GPT and like they are very similar.\n",
      "So we have one active.\n",
      "By killing that MLM thing and oh, yeah.\n",
      "I mean the next model that you are going to try to lessen our probability of masking a noun phrase that will fall in line with approximately because you cannot definitely definitive about it because you are doing the phrase level so you will approximately make it close to the bird trading strategy and then try to converse case walk.\n",
      "So now you have one extreme where you did not put any constraint on the probability of masking a noun phrase later ulis.\n",
      "And you will not you will end up it can also it may be possible that your current approach itself.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Yeah, so in order to add more contacts between the aggregated sentence features, which works very well.\n",
      "The issue now is the fact that if you have entity that has never been seen by the model before then you cannot have a sentence that it is a part of because that would because we do not have a sentence now we\n",
      "However, thinking of it like from a normal standpoint what this is.\n",
      "I thought that is what so I also checked the comparison between should we take the sentence as a query or should we take the entity as the query so the temple thought process here is that since it has learned to decent representation for the entity.\n",
      "We can take the entity itself and then get the similar sentence representation through the aggregated ones or take the sentence itself.\n",
      "This is not much difference between the two things where the query is different.\n",
      "The query has to be the whole sentence.\n",
      "It cannot be the single entity because\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "I have got that gets populated during which service should be accurately or should the platform.\n",
      "Victor should the platforms then the segment to this Louis has feel like every other service.\n",
      "Then it can get the segments automatically.\n",
      "So like from the publish this ad underscore segments topic is Caprice is just listening to it.\n",
      "Dont you think we should have this as Lambda or or because it is graph population.\n",
      "We do not want it to be a lamp.\n",
      "But small disconnect for me is what if I am big Dumbo what all these things and then I do the same way every time as if for the summary service also, we get all the segments like as soon as the segment is generated.\n",
      "Some disconnect it is not about whether we do it this way or not.\n",
      "And then as soon as it gets the segment it just it just extracts the key phrase the entities and then populate the graph and then and then we there am I missing something.\n",
      "So how different is it for the O of the Lambda to be waiting for that?\n",
      "Maybe it should not be part of an existing service.\n",
      "I because existing Services if they are if they are like a frontend reflection jobs like pimp some reason we do not want to mess up with your yeah, okay.\n",
      "Then we have to think of the right spot in the key phrases section service on where it should be happening because rest of the pre or post processing things are very negligible here because their sentence level in you are just aggregating dictionary of something and then they are not ankle.\n",
      "If you want to you want to be optimal about the computation.\n",
      "They are not bottleneck tasks.\n",
      "Under the separation keep to keep it simple.\n",
      "You want to optimize competition one one thing we can do is keep her service when it calls entity and it gets entities in the key phrase service can position our stop it.\n",
      "And so this this entity graph service will be listening to that topic and so it will basically get segment and entities it is no call for that.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "When you get you get something but you do not know what to do about it.\n",
      "What if what if you think things have two key phrases?\n",
      "So what is the major phrase or major?\n",
      "Major phrase in a sentence which is influencing default feature.\n",
      "Youre masking lot of context.\n",
      "Maybe you should reduce the just try to align with the XnumberX and fry.\n",
      "Well example and see how many noun phrase becoming and if they are more than XnumberX percent.\n",
      "It would be hard visual like like a mask only you have to do some observations based thresholding on that and then mask only those with the with like maybe XnumberX probability Mass call the not Damascus from Paris.\n",
      "Yeah, that is what so if that is if that model is performing way better than what we have right now.\n",
      "So it means that the entity should be given very much high priority over others in a particular sentence.\n",
      "It is respect to sentencing levity.\n",
      "Yeah that says the normal model.\n",
      "So if you choose to mask if noun presence and then try to learn a model and then if we see some different results.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Why should we invoke another Lambda?\n",
      "Why cannot you do all the population looted be bought?\n",
      "Here so only the Standalone graph population service.\n",
      "Was open yeah, so so so by doing this we are not invoking the entity extraction Lambda twice.\n",
      "Also you are using the entity extraction service right here.\n",
      "So, do you are you using the current four chapters?\n",
      "So this for definitely be better than space at least because that is the only Baseline we have.\n",
      "Yeah, so maybe it is not it is that is fine.\n",
      "I did not get the entities earlier, but now I got I do not know it just to look at it.\n",
      "I mean, I just he is done it again plus saying happened with that Curative on all sides.\n",
      "Try hittin it is just to be sure.\n",
      "So the communities we serve will we do not have anything like it is already in production.\n",
      "So we just need to keep a watch on there.\n",
      "And we will be discussing about possible improvements or I mean the cases where we should look at this morning.\n",
      "So so we keep waiting will make the observation base will as we get more calls and we will see where it is working out and we should look at it.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "But as I would just put a document just to be just to make sure that I am just listing out everything which I think needs Improvement.\n",
      "So again before too fi, oh the whole bunch of beautiful platinum singles.\n",
      "Okay on that Lambda anything.\n",
      "Yeah, we thought we will do it this week.\n",
      "Okay, actually, we also wanted to talk about that Master develop right?\n",
      "I know these are the same.\n",
      "We just copy some mindset or model side and push it there.\n",
      "Yeah, so it is easy to lose track of where we are copying or pasting it.\n",
      "So and it is not like a staging to environment directly push to production it still copypasting substrates, including multiple testing to production.\n",
      "So that the main reason was we were initially having some either because all the plumbing right now is only is three days away.\n",
      "So even there some problem might occur.\n",
      "So I just wanted to make sure that every time you push in just six with some basic validation scheme whether people to the right path.\n",
      "Like what was what was the kind of the model or particular term starting from servers?\n",
      "And then it would pull the model of mine from bsXnumberX then have some validations from behind planet and then push back to school.\n",
      "So for example, like if you push some ice in mind or SE model to production and then what it does is like because there is a new push to the GitHub.\n",
      "Then it would automatically have a gift of fashion which could trigger a script which would internally call Lambda.\n",
      "So with this land ourselves would get requests.\n",
      "We get some wine service been what model online that it needs to chill.\n",
      "For example, like if you have like two or three calls where they man, very targeted.\n",
      "What are the likely top concerns which we might get we always go because it is specific set of calls.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Okay, just give it to everyone update everyone.\n",
      "yeah, I think we discussed almost like both their action items and communities, but but you can just so sugarman is action template so Can we?\n",
      "So one potential Improvement is to find out the leakage is where in you you have you have confidence for a an action item?\n",
      "That means we are trying to find out if they are to two places to optimize that action items.\n",
      "like so and on the model part, we have not I do not think we need anything right now to I think the current model is suffice.\n",
      "So so if they are not if they are referring to prop up pronouns and we are just filtering out so that is one one candidate for improvement.\n",
      "Right one is the model LXnumberX at the post processing level.\n",
      "Fine actually, so we are discussing this morning about how to go about filtration.\n",
      "So the model we are just using the XnumberX conference threshold.\n",
      "I think that is fine for now the biggest One potential Improvement is that even your back?\n",
      "I mean the postprocessing steps that are causing this and then see how you can fix that.\n",
      "But it just got just got out because there is now there is the subject is not really qualitative.\n",
      "So for that currently again again under that we have we are addressing only the sentences that are having selfcontained subjects, right?\n",
      "So, so it is all about reducing the false positives and bye.\n",
      "It is giving enough false positives and true positive.\n",
      "So which which I think show em should be working on and then and then the other other one is there is there is a there is a The sentence is selfcontained.\n",
      "So we just need to find out the Mist Outpost.\n",
      "A decent enough representation this I doublechecked by comparing giving an entity and taking the most similar entity.\n",
      "So this works well for the most part but in terms of actual sentence to sentence comparisons, it does not make that much of a difference whether we use the in incremental approach or this approach.\n",
      "Whereas as a new directly Feed The Entity and you get it.\n",
      "So the only place actually see a difference is in this entities comparison.\n",
      "So that is something we want to take a look at.\n",
      "So I started testing GPT is ability to capture either data along with SE data by combining the data sets and then painting the model.\n",
      "So we found that training with a combination of two plus one second sentences in the IROC manner allowed it to capture context as update some of the tokens but this order to capture context or an entity level.\n",
      "But in terms of like little NSP comparisons is not much difference.\n",
      "Both in both cases the combined data sets one performs better than that one.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Like like if entities it has improved it should also improve on the gel in a totally unrelated sentences.\n",
      "Okay now coming back to what what SRI was pointing about comparing two sentences.\n",
      "That need not be true because if you are talking about contexts, then you are not only talking about Docker and kubernetes are also talking about a verb like context like testing and deployment right which does not really account for the end piece itself.\n",
      "So in that case the two models May differ because one is based on, you know, two plus one and neither has more context with four plus one sentences.\n",
      "But with so when we are doing all these aggregation of sentences, right?\n",
      "So that means that all these entities features get either added up or get zoomed in while other public testing these kind of phrases or words get Lift Away.\n",
      "For that sentence like instead of like if you create a new sentence, which has a new NPP somehow we should be able to reproduce it as if it is already present in the hole if it already does not like in XnumberX to XnumberX sentences.\n",
      "So instead of aggregating is it possible to select particular set of features for us, which is dominating.\n",
      "I mean if you could do that, we could we could do that to find the most similar entities, right?\n",
      "See it is this is a factual.\n",
      "This is lack of action information because there is a new entity and then you do not have enough context of where it can be used except the current sentence.\n",
      "So what I was trying to say is like you have a hundred sentences of XnumberX sentences, you know that there are some particular entities for example, like Docker which is kept on beating in all the hundred sentences.\n",
      "So now we take the aggregated feature Vector for this entity.\n",
      "Yes, not all these sentences right now.\n",
      "If you get a new entity something called as an eternal then we do not have some repeated understand sentences where the heat is being presented.\n",
      "So, but if we are able to find the dominating feature vector Our official of features which would be equal to using that same word ether in hundreds and Cancers.\n",
      "so to simplify for these aggregated sentences, right?\n",
      "There are set of features which are repeating throughout these sentences.\n",

So we are we are working on the what you call the then symbol for that like like them the back and model needed and then and then the processor so Shri Arjun and I are trying to work together on that to see where you know, how we can make the entity. You summaries for which we need a entity model, which Arjun is improving one and then mystery and I are working on experimenting with some approaches where we can aggregate this just segments or the sentences instead of going only by the segment.

      " Text:  yeah, I think we discussed almost like both their action items and communities, but but you can just so sugarman's action template so Can we? Okay, just give it to everyone update everyone.  hear you  talking  Yeah, I don't see his.  I'm coming up.  Fine actually, so we are discussing this morning about how to go about filtration. That means we're trying to find out if they're to two places to optimize that action items. Right one is the model L2 at the post processing level. So the model we are just using the 50% conference threshold. I think that's fine for now the biggest One potential Improvement is that even your back? Right? So one potential Improvement is to find out the leakage is where in you you have you have confidence for a an action item? But it just got just got out because there is now there is the subject isn't really qualitative. So for that currently again again under that we have we are addressing only the sentences that are having self-contained subjects, right? So so if they're not if they are referring to prop up pronouns and we are just filtering out so that's one one candidate for improvement. So which which I think show em should be working on and then and then the other other one is there is there is a there is a The sentence is self-contained. But still we are we are not we are just filtering it out. So we just need to find out the Mist Outpost. I mean the post-processing steps that are causing this and then see how you can fix that. like so and on the model part, we haven't I don't think we need anything right now to I think the current model is suffice. It is giving enough false positives and true positive. So, so it's all about reducing the false positives and bye.  nickel positives  Oh sure. Mr. Having problems.  on on the Hudson on the on the model part  So I started testing GPT is ability to capture either data along with SE data by combining the data sets and then painting the model. So we found that training with a combination of two plus one second sentences in the IROC manner allowed it to capture context as update some of the tokens but this order to capture context or an entity level. Whereas as a new directly Feed The Entity and you get it. A decent enough representation this I double-checked by comparing giving an entity and taking the most similar entity. So this works well for the most part but in terms of actual sentence to sentence comparisons, it doesn't make that much of a difference whether we use the in incremental approach or this approach. So the only place actually see a difference is in this entities comparison. So that's something we want to take a look at.  You mean when you say entity features are those the literal strings of the entities are the sentences?  Both in both cases the combined data sets one performs better than that one. But in terms of like little NSP comparisons is not much difference.  \n",

      " Text:  I'm choosing the latter. Actually. I'm testing testing both models using this entity to similarity because that's something that came up recently as a requirement for the moderate. So trying to use that as a test to see whether okay, you know, the engineering model is able to capture so  Is that is in Crystal? Anyway, the is that good enough test for the model? Oh, yeah over literally percent similarity think that we are that we've always been doing.  His sentencing narratives. Yeah. Yeah, that's what sentence ability wise. There's not too much difference between the old method and the new method is what I'm trying to say is I'm sorry.  I'm using this auxiliary task to compare the post with the models.  Based on our observation that been entity similarity improves then we also see that sentence invalid employment rate know that need not be necessary because the pious for a sentence should majorly come from entities, right?  But there's no guarantee that if you okay then then you have to isolate the validation. So that means you have to do is observe ation. You have to take the sentences with only with the entities and then compare that's one thing but that doesn't give you the view for the other one where you don't have an entity as learned by the bottle. I think we have to be specific the right when we talk about in detail. We had talked about the entities that are learned by the that are inferred by The Board model that has been trained.  Yes.  Okay. Okay, so  Identity similarity if you're talking about literal entity similarity, which means the string of the entity. I'm not sure if that's the right right way to answer your question. But if you don't know what the sentence well, maybe yes, I mean that the in DC Community feature is nothing but the aggregation of all the sentences that we that it is part of  So it's round after hearing about.  naughty sentences  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah, sorry. Anyway, I think both of these tests. So one was a literal string comparison of entities as well as the aggregated sentences. So while comparing these two methods are found that the aggregated sentences work better because JP has a tendency to select more similar words that start with the same letter. So ether it will sort of pick all tokens that are there in its reputation that start Withey similarly for Docker and stuff, yeah  Water level Thing by but there is no alphabet level. It's not it's not the alphabet level. Why would it do that?  Because when it's up when it updates a language model, it updates on a token level not on a word level. So see ya. So if you get Docker you'll get the and cker. Yeah, so it will also pick words that have Bo in it like the okay. I will be very similar to talker.  \n",

The issue now is the fact that if you have entity that has never been seen by the model before then you cannot have a sentence that it is a part of because that would because we don't have a sentence now we  right  I thought that's what so I also checked the comparison between should we take the sentence as a query or should we take the entity as the query so the temple thought process here is that since it has learned to decent representation for the entity. We can take the entity itself and then get the similar sentence representation through the aggregated ones or take the sentence itself. This is not much difference between the two things where the query is different. However, thinking of it like from a normal standpoint what this is.  Aizen  From what you said?

But what is the effective number of sentences in the contribution first contribution of that? What is that? Just let me mute.  From what I've seen I also did the number of sentences check and there isn't a correlation between number of sentences and relation to the entity. So that was actually pretty surprising. So if you have one thing it's not necessary that there isn't any correlation like if I take two entities, yeah, if I take two entities, even if they have like very few sentences in common, they may still get a higher score than two. Entities with like many more sentences in common. This is I will ratio-wise.  If there is an entity with only two sentences, there is there is there is there is a very good chance that this most similar entities would have got 200 sentences. It has no relation.  It's not.  That's your parents. Actually when you're doing when you encounter a new entity. Yes, you can you can safely go for it.  The aggregated features of all the known entities and should they get the good results?  Yep. Okay, that is good. So that is interesting. Yeah. So the basic thing is if suppose you encounter an entity in a sentence if the sentence has more than one new entity in a then you are essentially comparing the same sentence for both entities like yeah, hence it is bad. So I thought in that case continued use the query has like a combination of both as in cosine similarity of the entity as it is. Plus like the center said it's a part of in case of similar entity. That's what I'm saying.  Okay, let's let's keep it simple. So let's try to address the cases where you have one unknown entity in a meeting. Then we'll in a single occurrence. Then we'll solve this we will take it as we observe it. Okay?  Maybe that's that's deviation. Let's let's hope that's like a corner case.  \n",

      " Text:  Okay now coming back to what what SRI was pointing about comparing two sentences. He says that they are there douche must be related. Like like if entities it has improved it should also improve on the gel in a totally unrelated sentences.  That need not be true because if you're talking about contexts, then you're not only talking about Docker and kubernetes are also talking about a verb like context like testing and deployment right which doesn't really account for the end piece itself. So in that case the two models May differ because one is based on, you know, two plus one and neither has more context with four plus one sentences. So it need not be just entities is what I'm trying to say.  but when you do aggregation of all  But with so when we are doing all these aggregation of sentences, right? So that means that all these entities features get either added up or get zoomed in while other public testing these kind of phrases or words get Lift Away.  Yeah.  No, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, I guess what?  So instead of aggregating is it possible to select particular set of features for us, which is dominating. For that sentence like instead of like if you create a new sentence, which has a new NPP somehow we should be able to reproduce it as if it is already present in the hole if it already doesn't like in 10 to 20 sentences.  Because you'd better sentence picture.  He's going to say as if as if this is not if you can bypass the consent of having only single current sentence for the for this entity, that means somehow gathered the context from the known entities and then try to build a better representation.  That he'd be as good as fine. I mean if you could do that, we could we could do that to find the most similar entities, right? See it's this is a factual. This is lack of action information because there is a new entity and then you don't have enough context of where it can be used except the current sentence. So this is not about difference. I think I feel  So what I was trying to say is like you have a hundred sentences of 1800 sentences, you know that there are some particular entities for example, like Docker which is kept on beating in all the hundred sentences. So now we take the aggregated feature Vector for this entity. Yes, not all these sentences right now. If you get a new entity something called as an eternal then we don't have some repeated understand sentences where the heat is being presented. So, but if we are able to find the dominating feature vector Our official of features which would be equal to using that same word ether in hundreds and Cancers. Okay.  You know what you're trying to say if I have to codify what you're trying to say, you're asking you're asking to do the same similarity between this current sentence and all the candidates sentences from which it is function separately and then take the top 10 or 15 in deities to find out context.  I don't know.  so to simplify for these aggregated sentences, right? There are set of features which are repeating throughout these sentences.  \n",

That's what I'm going to do it. So if we can find a subset assume that it is been pointing to some kind of a common pattern in all those in multiple cases then instead of trying to find a hundred sentences sentences for particular intervening. We can take the pattern of subsets for one single sentence itself.  girl  Nice and this magnifying a subset of that?  but how do you select the subset that keeps changing then you will end up not being able to compare that with the other entity features because  But we haven't explored to say that it is changing, right? Okay.  That is different. But let's assume that for two entities effect. If you can rank the features, but you cannot subset the pages as soon as the subset the features out of 768 you lose the ability to compare because you will always compare you have to compare against those feature in this. He's not others.  I think okay. Okay. That's the whole you whole line of experimentation. I think subsetting the feature space. Maybe we can we can start that and then see what is this baguette as a parallel with this is trying to bring it into the current means to  right  But what you're talking about the sentence the sentence comparison do we do you have any conflicting observations? So then what do you expect about about those things? Because when you're talking about the verbs and phrases, right? So is it a good idea for us to learn the context like how we are learning the context of entities you think it's a good idea to learn the context of so, that's what this is. Like me when you when you talked about that.  I was kind of thinking about that but I wasn't sure what the expected outcome would be.  I'm not it's easy.  Music experiment I mean expectations. I don't know it's difficult to anticipate but it's very easy to experiment. What if we what if we could embed All the known works and then and then and then what do we do? But yeah.

So if you if you beat right key phrase comparison, but at least for me didn't work out. Well, that means take only the key phrases and then try to compare it in make any difference. Actually. It's as nice idea sentence comparison.  It's not about if a similarity but but instead of trying to compare the whole sentence for to form the cosine distance between them. Is there a better way like one obvious way is to do the entity comparison. Can we can we do? Augmenting the data comparison is wanting to when there is no entity. How do you compare to keep two sentences?  From my test. I thought we could use the refresh similarity as a start where the key phrase is given as it is as it takes feature, not the sentence. It's a part of  And you query against the same thing every key phrase on its own without any sentence context. Okay, that seems to be working pretty decent.

I did I did Master language model on the whole essay data masking only noun phrases. So that is  But if you must but what are you calling that bird sampling strategy of 15% or you don't?  Five for I don't like every so what this MLM training task is you take the entire chunk of text divided into sections of 512 pounds each and then in each of these 512 tokens, you find all the non-faces and mask them.  Okay, always.  Always yeah.  they would be very high actually, so that would if you fall if you literally follow Pirtle only mask 50% of tokens, but every  You do that it won't be able to generalize it won't be hard.  You're masking lot of context. Maybe you should reduce the just try to align with the 15% and fry. That means take firefight. Well example and see how many noun phrase becoming and if they are more than 50 percent. It would be hard visual like like a mask only you have to do some observations based thresholding on that and then mask only those with the with like maybe 80% probability Mass call the not Damascus from Paris.  Now if you are actually building the stick to God because that's like let's assume that they have done enough experiments on that and then came up with the specialty right so that way you can be alive.  Makes sense here.  Because that experiment should tell us something about what is the major bias in people's.  Yeah, that's what so if that is if that model is performing way better than what we have right now. It's respect to sentencing levity. So it means that the entity should be given very much high priority over others in a particular sentence. Yeah.  No, it won't give any priority because it has no priority towards any of the 4 Stacks here entities became important because we have learned representations for the Olympics.

We have to experiment Yes.  about that mask  And this noun phrase thing? All we're trying to do is we are trying to force the model to to to rely on noun phrases. So we will get a model that focuses on noun phrase instead of the whole. So all the parts tags. Then what?  And exactly sure whether it is good or bad.  That I don't know if it is good. I'm just saying I'm just telling all these things as they are, you know is good.  If it is bad, then we are expecting a complete mismatch in the user.

But small disconnect for me is what if I am big Dumbo what all these things and then I do the same way every time as if for the summary service also, we get all the segments like as soon as the segment is generated.  So how different is it for the O of the Lambda to be waiting for that? And then as soon as it gets the segment it just it just extracts the key phrase the entities and then populate the graph and then and then we there am I missing something.  The same thing, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  Either you can be part of existing service, or if it if you want it to be separated then whatever process you mentioned mentioned that will be.  Maybe it shouldn't be part of an existing service. I because existing Services if they are if they are like a front-end reflection jobs like pimp some reason we don't want to mess up with your yeah, okay.  Does that mean that we have to give one more call to The Entity service and get the entities for it or flip the question is there is always that is currently giving making a call to entity service only keep the only key phrases. Oh, so now your question is whether we should call it again. Yeah.  I don't know should be.  We don't get that decided a molesting face always from it.  Yeah, we don't need that right so it can wait this can wait because this is often competition. Now often in the sense, it can be slow.  But why would you get that entities?  Under the separation keep to keep it simple. It could be separate. If you want to you want to be optimal about the computation. Then we have to think of the right spot in the key phrases section service on where it should be happening because rest of the pre or post processing things are very negligible here because their sentence level in you're just aggregating dictionary of something and then they are not ankle. They are not bottleneck tasks.  You want to optimize competition one one thing we can do is keep her service when it calls entity and it gets entities in the key phrase service can position our stop it. And so this this entity graph service will be listening to that topic and so it will basically get segment and entities it is no call for that.  \n",

      " Text:  Why should we invoke another Lambda? Why can't you do all the population looted be bought?  Just take start time.  Yeah better to keep everything separate.  Was open yeah, so so so by doing this we are not invoking the entity extraction Lambda twice. Here so only the Standalone graph population service.  But anyway, will we do okay God? Yeah.  We'll start it that way maybe we can talk to Karthik once and see if he has any inputs and then we'll do it this way and if this is fine.  Okay, got it. At least we'll start populating then we'll think of where to use the event unless the mind or something. Yeah. Got it.  So, do you are you using the current four chapters? Also you're using the entity extraction service right here.  On the look. They're not bad.  You can see here actually are getting GPT MLM.  The Mask language model became an entity we got buttons.  Zoom as India  Yeah, I don't know the Miss months. But but the whatever has come up are really the really sound like entities.  Yeah, it's not that.  Yeah, so maybe it's not it's that's fine. So this for definitely be better than space at least because that's the only Baseline we have.  Otherwise what we have I think they have any do we have any open source models that we can often compared other than Spacey?  But most of these are all case models may be biased towards would be like comparing every capitalized word against these entities at people.  Yeah, so even even the even we have observed that even bird base models are like that, right?  Yeah, baby shifted completely to on his mom.  Yeah, yeah.  Then then find it then we have to we'll see fine.  so I think I think three you you're you're fine with the deployment, right?  One second Lincoln. I'm just joking with her.  Carry on what he said something.  So what can get the Highlights for one particular short console is just gorgeous.  editing the cases  Try hittin it is just to be sure. I mean, I just he's done it again plus saying happened with that Curative on all sides. I didn't get the entities earlier, but now I got I don't know it just to look at it.  So the communities we serve will we don't have anything like it's already in production. So we just need to keep a watch on there. and then  And we will be discussing about possible improvements or I mean the cases where we should look at this morning. So so we keep waiting will make the observation base will as we get more calls and we'll see where it is working out and we should look at it.  \n",

We also share that results that we were talking about it. So again before too fi, oh the whole bunch of beautiful platinum singles. Yeah.  first podcast I mix playlist singles team specific and then and then very specific discussion like like, aw, whatever we have four levels of the body called different ranges in which we can discussion can be  Yeah.  Don't ever say I'm just giving an extra so just for see a CD for us so that whenever we deploy some either new model - or some algorithm it would just invoke that gland and then some variations and then push it to slack saying whether it is healthy or not.  Okay, actually, we also wanted to talk about that Master develop right? I know these are the same. Yeah, we thought we will do it this week. Okay on that Lambda anything.  Nothing specific. So that the main reason was we were initially having some either because all the plumbing right now is only is three days away. We just copy some mindset or model side and push it there. Yeah, so it's easy to lose track of where we are copying or pasting it. So and it's not like a staging to environment directly push to production it still copy-pasting substrates, including multiple testing to production. So even there some problem might occur. So I just wanted to make sure that every time you push in just six with some basic validation scheme whether people to the right path.  Okay. Got it. Yeah, so that means you need to manually update the Lambda every time we make changes to the paths.  So for example, like if you push some ice in mind or SE model to production and then what it does is like because there is a new push to the GitHub. Then it would automatically have a gift of fashion which could trigger a script which would internally call Lambda. So with this land ourselves would get requests. Like what was what was the kind of the model or particular term starting from servers? We get some wine service been what model online that it needs to chill. And then it would pull the model of mine from bs3 then have some validations from behind planet and then push back to school.  like validation script four-footed validate  For example, like if you have like two or three calls where they man, very targeted. What are the likely top concerns which we might get we always go because it is specific set of calls.  \n",

It will just put that it is unhealthy and we have chicken.  karthikeya  so we need to hit update the validation data like whenever we want to yeah.  Find yeah. Hey guys. I'm sorry.  That is just one thing which I'm just barely working but it is both the GitHub repo and the validations in which it would be about both. I would finish please.  Okay, yeah.  During the column a destiny.  Yeah here in the yes. He's got some really don't know it just happening on and off. It's possible that it could be because of the program. very could have just  I don't know. I mean, I'm just trying it again. I just ran it in the name we got.  So Sunday on the recommended Roger Fisher any observation because last time you wanted to share some you. This we had if we had a discussion which would include site because the way you are getting the whatever I don't I vaguely remember but the way of aggregation there was conflict whether it works or not works.  Yeah, so now right now I'm not advocating any feature vectors or anything. So the way I'm testing it right now is so say in summary we get a highlight right so that the set of keywords in those in that highlight will be the query will be against which we want to check what other similar works. And the complete list of similar words comes from the D graph query for all the users.  Got it. So.  so now what happens is and then so if we have each other because for this highlight key words and then we get features actors for all the keywords of the users.  We need to do similarity measure. Now. The problem is when I checked on the staging to data the drawer there were 29 users with key phrases and are they around five or six of them had at least 1200 key phrases as  Oh, that's not that's okay. Okay.  So the way I was doing it initially was a so I was using like a proximate search kind of thing which reduces such things initially. So if I agree at all the key phrases of the users, then it comes out to be around like 4,000 5,000. The next video is so space to 1,000 or 2,000 something based on threshold and then from like proper cosine similarity match. So the in stage Going to I was testing right? So the that's what it shows. Yeah, when it shows the top three users. So those top three are based on the approximate such thing. Then I take the key phases of all these top three users and then make a like proper comparison. Okay, and then I show you related keywords, but  So the search engine so Jen comparison parties working finals faster than just cosine work dries cosine similarity. Okay, the result is not conclusive because of skewed is to data. Yeah.  \n",

      " Text:  Yeah, it's a good day. Only I like transformed all the production data and now I'm ready to decaf. Yeah. So once I have it in the graph, then I will run it again and check how it looks for production.  But I think I somehow feel recommendation of a topic can be a lot more mature than just stood match.  Yeah, it's not the string match person. It's Cena.  He faced match our feature color match because you know, there is lot of okay. Okay, so do you think if you do if we instead do it entity base? Would it be best we have  Could be better just go information right now.  But it's but don't you think it can or maybe M complicating? Okay, let's let's take it one step at a time. So they also it.  Yeah, the idea is like this. So this one Whatever result is gives is like the most basic way of getting the users.  So the idea is like what if this works then the the additional work on top of this would be to backfill all the segments with proper entities from a new entity extraction in order to replace the key phrases and also use information like recency and everything because I don't because ideally we don't want key phrases from the beginning of like what yeah.  yeah, it makes sense to if there are entities it makes sense to recommend the entities instead of key phrases like  Yeah, so like as opposed to purchasing it would be ideal to just give them like related keywords should be related entities. Yeah, if not entities then at least noun phrase.  The second priority should be the key phrases. Yeah.  So what are our deployed on staging to was just to see how fast got? Oh yes competition.  big graph mostly on the retrieval site  Yeah, they are not directly querying DeGraff when I did it on staging silly talk because we don't have DeGraff instance. Right? Like I'm not publicly anything to degraaf instance on AWS. So it's just a that the data are stored it as Jason. So it's only Computing feature vectors and doing approximate match.  Okay. Okay. Got it. So if we are all on the same lines, but for the entity graph, so are we going to how do we do? So the Lambda service would be populating the Digraph is it?  And I found the Lambda service can just populate a network. It's object on the or it can just take it as a Json object, which is compatible for DeGraff.  Maneuver to be howdy graph instance we can make an omelet.  Then the transition won't be problematic, right? So it's like so now we have like forever a persistent Network X pickle. It's an S3 to keep its in S3 and then we keep upright a replacing that after every meal.  If you want to like use bigger right away, then we can set it up on like it's already running on GPU instant GP work.  You tell what to do.  I think like we we can we can have it right as Network X object the ETL code. Is there any way so you can convert 2D graph kind of data and populate to our AGP workstation so that we can directly use the graph fairies instead of neck?  Regarded. Yeah, then we'll do that. Okay.  Then slowly once we know what we want to persist and all those things and we can bypass Network it single resistance.  By the way on the 80 Days actually mask language model and mass language model both came up.  One of them is key phrases unless all the first letters are capitalized and it's not active.  Okay, so I was thinking that it's about it. Yes. I am confused. So it's not an entity then. Yep.  Masking model as an entity must measure.  Okay, so even when you're off for we see there are he cut off, okay.  is basically you can just be thinking they can be. Okay. Yeah, so  Shipping when you rap I don't have everyone was on the airplane, but I just updated on what you're trying to do with three or four possibility candidates for finding out false negatives.  And directed digest so the guy time focusing only on the subject is within the subject within the sentence. Okay. So the constant quality forward I was taking its back. So so I think I use and u.s. Speakers will meeting which has been used because those are better quality and Is there a again I was able to find some false negatives but generally enin speakers the sponsor quality is bad. If you read it. You can make make out that it's an action item, but the transcripts were so bad that that is literally if you read the sentence it's it's it's not connected transfer transcripts. Okay.  Then maybe we should not we should not worry about it right now because I think language construction is actually important because we are going by grammar. Rules There Is No Escape for that.  And like butter salt collecting false negative and I thought that was able to find out and I end I end users.  No, actually we thought you you're going to find out some test calls tested data set up for the web to validate this right?  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I'll try to find out some data from use late. They dubbed as the videos which are your brothers? That's what I was thinking.  \n",

Let's see.  audience  I think yeah, it's just you know.  They once you tested you just let me know then we can then I can rebase or whatever it is. Yeah mind. There are.  Here's our love Geneva III. This is getting hard so our time because I have lot of small small commits that I have built up.  What happens is when I rebates it goes supplies on top of every commit and have the kids.  I just take the current development mode it to my Visa bans because all the comments in one shot and then merge it back to dollar.  You do get it much. Okay, okay.  So I had the problem I think last time also because I generally keep small small combats with more descriptive anymore what's changing but I have a lot of comment generally in a feature Branch. So when I went everywhere be in a very committed I'm getting rebates or acts like conflicts. Correct? Pretty much resolve all the commit history in my teacher, but who did much develop that means from a feature branch? I was at the other Branch into my feature Branch resolve the conflicts in one shot and then  one more coming  As a magic away, that's the most common and then feature branch is resolved. So then the dimension we March back.  A lot of people say it's better because you don't know destructive editing. That means you're not changing the commit history because of rebase and just try to avoid the next recommend impossible. That's one of the better side.  But at some point you can still do it gets crash, right?  We can squash the question is do squash after the reviewer before the so for me I prefer to people to see like small small keep committing incrementally. So people see the changes so I don't squash before.  Better you must because a lot of code changes exact similar file similar lines.  reading in the museum  Yeah, yeah - inter-korea have to commit symbol.

Barbara Nation I do with all entry points and disaster man and the book meeting. We're headed for a wherever board level validation is required because you can go lower already clicked a civilization bottle variation. We need to do meeting you can do beating neural.

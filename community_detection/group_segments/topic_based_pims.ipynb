Catalyzing the overall growth and traditional energy. So they're puts and takes that net. We're proud of the work across everything that we're doing to support sustainability. \n",

      "Segment:  Our next question comes from Steven Chu from Credit Suisse your line is now open. Thank you so so much. I was wondering if you can put Quantum Computing advancement into some sort of perspective. The completely for people has to be exponentially higher versus when you first launch the were wondering if this helps you get your arms around that ever-increasing compute needs and further. I think you'll find that investors. I was impatient as you guys are for Progress. Okay, talk about what kind of products Or services. This will help you create. You know, I'm really proud of the work that the team did and excited about that transparent and you know the whole industry, you know, I think in general, you know, obviously we've relied on advances in Computing to be able to do what we do and when we look at it, you know, we definitely see being able to drive the pace of change your fastest is an important. I mean for us as well as I think source of competitive Advantage, you know, as as Moore's Law affect serve diminished, I think you know, we are looking at a variety of approaches to make sure we can continue doing what we need to do in that need is an important tool in the Arsenal while Quantum will take you know, many years to really start making a difference. We want to be at The Cutting Edge. Driving it. I don't think you know over time for sure Cloud itself. We do see a lot of interest from Cloud to Cloud customers particularly cutting-edge verticals about about Quantum Computing. And so I'm so that's an area where I think of will participate in as a business and more importantly applying it across other. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment:  In other words because we are and be in health, you know, as an example, I think would be better if you will deliver value in the long run and and such as were extremely excited about the long-term implications for Quantum Computing part of your question there about Arc near-term Computing requirements, given our Outlook and particular across Google. We do expect to see ongoing demand for compute Investments to support our growth particularly for machine learning cloudsearch. Each in few to and the truck the primary driver of capex does continue to be our expectations for computer requirements. So that's Benson the technical infrastructure as we talked about today. Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill from Jeffries your line is now open. I need to go ahead set investments in your situation having both infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways. You can go and CP and just one follow-up with root you delivered it to some Gigi. Some G3 pricing changes and I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year and I was just curious if you were referring to that could change earlier in Europe. There was something new thank you. You know what? I mean? You're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, you know, we treat them that way obviously we've talked a lot about gcp but Jesus feet, you know continues to be very differentiated and you know, we just announced A new leader. I have your so coming in with lots of experience to turbocharge this this area as well and in general the many, you know, G sweet customers now with whom we are having GC. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment:  Conversations and vice versa. So I think in general given me have a bigger Market effort the breath you have allows us to have more conversations and engage too many different paths in the organization. So it's very synergistic as well. And in terms of the G sweet pricing it was referencing the pricing that we announced back in April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was it was the right time increase prices. Given that the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G sweet. And as I said it, you know what we're seeing here is an addition to the benefit from the price change. We also continue to have my seat growth. Thank you. Thank you and our final question comes from one of Justin post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open YouTube subscriptions and maybe give us an update on how your subscription product is doing versus expectations. And then on the growth accelerated 18 percent. Anything to call out there, especially related to YouTube any change the coverage on going on or anything we should know about thank you, you know, you know with subscriptions is an idiot. We are definitely excited about, you know, just please for that option so far across both YouTube music and your team premium debug day now available in 71 countries from five markets at the start of 2018. So we are definitely scaling that up and we are saying Great collections YouTube TV is also doing well. I think we just announced the PBS is coming to YouTube TV in July last month. We announced You Tube TVs now lodging on select Amazon Fire TV devices, so there is definitely \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment:  And that user satisfaction on the product is very high. And so we're focused on containing our expansion putting out a great service and bullying awareness for the service. So, you know overall I think engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube. There's a focus for us and the efforts like early or definitely showing strong protection and then you asked about click growth in the trend there the thickest Drive Iver affecting the click Trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement as as in the the first and second quarter the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. It does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and Advertiser experience. And as we talked about a prior calls that did have an impact on click growth, but as we also talked about Out they weren't related to those changes in 2018 were not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube Revenue, so not a read-through. Thank you. Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Allen West 20 closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you again and have a good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. \n",

      "So as we look out towards like XnumberX and Beyond you feel like a lot of the products here is in a good place as far as search and YouTube are concerned and that you know, these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future just make over there.\n",
      "And then on the third quarter de journee je the growth rate was solid but at lower than the prior Trends or anything notable to call out on a pack.\n",
      "So in terms of the first question, you know, I think it is very I talked about we are pleased with the Strength of the business that you have seen here again in the third quarter as we said since the IPO, we do not manage the business to maximize quarterly results and will always do the right thing for the long term.\n",
      "Were very focused on investing for the longterm and tried to make it clear in opening comments that you know, as a result quarterly growth can bury and have buried and you know, I think to your question in our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you you have seen since the beginning of the year for us underscore the strengthen and the vibrancy actually in our business and that is particularly true at our size in the last XnumberX months.\n",
      "Weve generated over a hundred fifty billion in total revenues.\n",

      "Your line is now open Professor Tabor question.\n",
      "Somebody talked about the new neural network techniques part of the biggest breakthrough in Search and years.\n",
      "You can help us understand if that is acting that the advertise your monthly anytime, you know, maybe I will answer it does.\n",
      "The car which is the name of the technique we are using and we rolled it out in search now and it just you know, obviously anytime we can better make sense of queries, you know, we can serve users better search quality goes up and when people engage and it is okay engage more so it is part of a longrunning set of things we have been working on but this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experience and search quality and roboticle.\n",
      "Us in a certain set of queries very many queries which are already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better.\n",
      "And so I would just get a price this as a big Improvement which improve search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more.\n",
      "Weve always invested in tackling deep computer science problems that can have a significant impact on society the chance to be part of these fundamentals of engineering challenges is why so many people want to work at Google\n",

      "I just wanted to follow up on a couple of the comments you made about about clouds Thunder.\n",
      "I was wondering if you can just give us some color on the size of your gcd backlog and maybe even if you just talk about the trajectory and how that has changed over the course of the last year and then I need you mentioned the strength and the uptake of bigquery on the front think through how we should think of the margin level of a service like this versus the traditional compete offerings where you have seen strike the date and just wondering if we start this start to see some positive positive mix shift benefits that some of these premium products start to start to ramp more aggressively.\n",
      "And thanks are you know overall?\n",
      "You know, I know we gave some visibility into our Cloud business and will continue to do that, you know periodically and you know momentum has been great, you know, obviously, you know ever since Thomas is coming.\n",

      "Service layer circus biggest report question for bigger picture nature.\n",
      "We are very excited by division of finding Computing and evolving that I think it is to continuity in the sense that over time Computing should be more intuitive to users and Computing should add up to users not the other way around and you know, the foundations of all this is all the work we have done with our Computing platforms till date and you know in the successful consumer services and the developer platform sui being built and I think that is the you know, most of the Investments their thoughts will continue to be at the center of ambient Computing for the Future so that is that is another important piece where we are already invested in.\n",
      "I think that is we expand Beyond and that is what the made by Google family is focused on products in your home with our next family of products and their bowls which we do with whether was and so on so supporting that ecosystem.\n",

      "The completely for people has to be exponentially higher versus when you first launch the were wondering if this helps you get your arms around that everincreasing compute needs and further.\n",
      "So over time I see this important area for us, you know, and it is done and closed, you know, it is part of our research and knowledge efforts and you do not have to be do that, you know, you can imagine you may have started a query in Search and it is a session may be looking to take a trip somewhere or\n",

      "Complex tasks so things like planning vacations of the insurance options with what we see is users continue to go back to desktop notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile.\n",

      "Us our investments in machine learning or helping as well.\n",
      "Of course A lot of times we take the same techniques and sometimes it makes sense of that ad side and down the line in machine learning techniques and will deploy it there as well.\n",
      "The time the percentage of time for which we were eligible are compared to two years ago to last year to now.\n",

      "In other words because we are and be in health, you know, as an example, I think would be better if you will deliver value in the long run and and such as were extremely excited about the longterm implications for Quantum Computing part of your question there about Arc nearterm Computing requirements, given our Outlook and particular across Google.\n",
      "We do expect to see ongoing demand for compute Investments to support our growth particularly for machine learning cloudsearch.\n",
      "Each in few to and the truck the primary driver of capex does continue to be our expectations for computer requirements.\n",

We do expect to see ongoing demand for compute Investments to support our growth particularly for machine learning cloudsearch.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill from Jeffries your line is now open. I need to go ahead set investments in your situation having both infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways. You can go and CP and just one follow-up with root you delivered it to some Gigi. Some G3 pricing changes and I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year and I was just curious if you were referring to that could change earlier in Europe. There was something new thank you. You know what? I mean? You're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, you know, we treat them that way obviously we've talked a lot about gcp but Jesus feet, you know continues to be very differentiated and you know, we just announced A new leader. I have your so coming in with lots of experience to turbocharge this this area as well and in general the many, you know, G sweet customers now with whom we are having GC.  \n",

So, you know overall I think engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube. There's a focus for us and the efforts like early or definitely showing strong protection and then you asked about click growth in the trend there the thickest Drive Iver affecting the click Trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement as as in the the first and second quarter the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. It does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and Advertiser experience. And as we talked about a prior calls that did have an impact on click growth, but as we also talked about Out they weren't related to those changes in 2018 were not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube Revenue, so not a read-through. Thank you. Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Allen West 20 closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call.

      " Text:  Daughter of Aunt Peggy Cinder in the third quarter total revenues of 40 point five billion or a 20 percent year-on-year and I'm 22 percent in constant currency. Once again, our results were driven by ongoing strength in mobile search YouTube and Cloud. I will begin with a review of the quarter on a Consolidated basis for alphabet focusing on year-over-year changes. I will then review results for Google followed by other bets and conclude with our out. Look so number and I will then take your questions. Details of the alphabets Consolidated revenues by geographic region are available in our earnings, press release regarding our key expense lines on a Consolidated basis total cost of revenues including tag, which I will discuss in the Google segment was seventeen point six billion of 23 percent year-on-year other cost of Revenue was on a Consolidated basis was 10.1 billion of 31 percent year-over-year. Primarily driven by Google related expenses the biggest contributor again. This quarter was costs associated with our data centers and other operations including depreciation followed by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube and mostly for advertising-supported Content, but also for our newer subscription businesses YouTube premium and YouTube TV, which have higher CAC as a percentage of their revenues this line also, includes the impact of Hardware costs primarily associated with our mid-tier pixel 3 a smartphones operating expenses were 13.8 billion with headcount growth being the largest driver of year-on-year growth for both Rd and sales and marketing which is reflected in both compensation and Facilities expenses. With respect to our D the growth was again.  But the addition of engineering Talent consistent with our focus on product Innovation the increase in TNA year-over-year was primarily due to a 554 million dollar charge from our previously announced legal settlement in France. Stock based compensation totaled 2.6 billion head count was up 6450 for the second quarter and consistent with prior quarters. The majority of new hires were engineers and product managers in terms of product areas the most sizable head count increases or again in Cloud for both Technical and sales roles operating income was nine point two billion up six percent year-over-year for operating. Origin of 23% other income and expense was a loss of five hundred and forty nine million which primarily reflects the impact of unrealized losses and marketable Equity Securities, as of September 30 the unrealised equity gain in the combined portfolio of marketable and non-marketable securities was 5.8 billion dollars. We provide more detail on the line items within a whiny in our earnings. This press release net income was 7.1 billion in earnings per diluted share or 10 dollars and twelve cents turning now to capex and operating cash flow cash capex for the quarter was 6.7 billion, which I will discuss in the Google segment results operating cash flow was fifteen point five billion with free cash flow of eight point seven billion. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately. 121 billion let me now turn to our segment Financial results starting with the Google segment revenues were 40 point three billion up 20% year-over-year.  \n",

      " Text:  In other words because we are and be in health, you know, as an example, I think would be better if you will deliver value in the long run and and such as were extremely excited about the long-term implications for Quantum Computing part of your question there about Arc near-term Computing requirements, given our Outlook and particular across Google. We do expect to see ongoing demand for compute Investments to support our growth particularly for machine learning cloudsearch. Each in few to and the truck the primary driver of capex does continue to be our expectations for computer requirements. So that's Benson the technical infrastructure as we talked about today. Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill from Jeffries your line is now open. I need to go ahead set investments in your situation having both infrastructure and productivity applications. Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways. You can go and CP and just one follow-up with root you delivered it to some Gigi. Some G3 pricing changes and I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year and I was just curious if you were referring to that could change earlier in Europe. There was something new thank you. You know what? I mean? You're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, you know, we treat them that way obviously we've talked a lot about gcp but Jesus feet, you know continues to be very differentiated and you know, we just announced A new leader. I have your so coming in with lots of experience to turbocharge this this area as well and in general the many, you know, G sweet customers now with whom we are having GC.  And that user satisfaction on the product is very high. And so we're focused on containing our expansion putting out a great service and bullying awareness for the service. So, you know overall I think engaging users with premium offerings on YouTube. There's a focus for us and the efforts like early or definitely showing strong protection and then you asked about click growth in the trend there the thickest Drive Iver affecting the click Trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement as as in the the first and second quarter the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. It does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and Advertiser experience. And as we talked about a prior calls that did have an impact on click growth, but as we also talked about Out they weren't related to those changes in 2018 were not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube Revenue, so not a read-through. Thank you. Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Allen West 20 closing remarks. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call. Thank you again and have a good evening. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.  \n",

      "Their communities started the summary and the under Community with summaries.\n",
      "So we are we are working on the what you call the then symbol for that like like them the back and model needed and then and then the processor so Shri Arjun and I are trying to work together on that to see where you know, how we can make the entity.\n",

      "It shows all those strangers, but when you build it and give the same source to our app.\n",
      "It is also depends on how much knowledge you guys have on signaling on its take and how much information you know, how to Multiplex the you know, it is not the sweetest in my platoon is also and Link Network.\n",
      "It is everything that they do on top of the Gypsy meet since you maybe if you want to go through the code base little bit and then you get instant it is better but an alternate approach could be ironic sustainable want is that do all right approach?\n",

      "That has the place for Distributing.\n",
      "The reaching meet with the other is just raise if we can know we can add a configuration disappear and emergent.\n",
      "That is one more thing.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "But much more than the feel like I have recipe are and like it is take a lot of time.\n",
      "Theyll reply like after XnumberX bleeding.\n",
      "I can raise up your for that also if we can spend some time on using legitimate and mimicking or gypsum.\n",
      "It would be easier for us to fall in like the photo.\n",
      "Yeah, but from what I have tested it is not straightforward and people have said the same thing and it is not even consistent with the telling on the network errors that you see, it is Amin handles.\n",
      "We were facing a lot of issues and a lot of comments on this.\n",
      "We are saying that you know, it is not as easy as it sounds so just letting you know think if it is easy to just provide an option like in the Json.\n",
      "to hide the config in a CPR Just make it high double like in the sense that option to hide the top portion.\n",
      "That is good that we the faster we do it for now always ask for thing and it seemed to me that part.\n",
      "For the month like I just went through like it is not a stable version It is Alpha version of something and when I navigate about information, it says company Google and also the Dozer name as Firefox.\n",
      "So I think once the stable version comes with it will be buggy and it because it fails to load our application.\n",
      "That was the problem but\n",
      "We are not using it in the react app.\n",
      "So it is from the library itself one of the from one of the libraries.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "It says Firefox or something.\n",
      "And once that means was wrong then with other libraries also because it is not reaching you until our AB dot J is before that only it says undefined some binding is undefined.\n",
      "Okay, so I definitely Inspire respect of this we need to get better at capturing errors and being able to look at them differently.\n",
      "So maybe you can check because I know we had but two bucks integration implemented so far we should send it if that is an exception.\n",
      "It is an undefined exception.\n",
      "I am kind of in visited.\n",
      "Although I will just set now only and then I will proceed with the other.\n",
      "Yeah, so like we facing this issue, so I wanted to test the upgrade in the physical device.\n",
      "But when I saw that I am not able to run that in the device.\n",
      "So like I am working on it and we will get to know you get on a call.\n",
      "Well try and six position.\n",
      "On a local machine we are able to debug the app like run both the debug and release versions, but on the device debug version we are not able to do.\n",
      "So is the release version running find on the yeah the release version?\n",
      "We can have account ID and\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "That is a record for Zoom.\n",
      "Maybe you can also check with brown shade starting to work on the zoom integration limits.\n",
      "Yeah discussion yesterday fortunately could be the concept.\n",
      "And also it is not that does not show up in the join list like the front end in the clients.\n",
      "So you can put your second events also was working for unexpected ones out then that I have like there is a dissipation Industries now, then there are few Sports.\n",
      "Also we need lll go through this code.\n",
      "Oops, mr. Scopes that you needed because and then get user by user ID.\n",
      "You need them to send emails to the organizer.\n",
      "The cast will not be shown to anybody.\n",
      "It is not or you prefer anything else.\n",
      "You can launch a WPA will support it but joining never showed.\n",
      "Yeah, you cannot in front and the other the API will support it.\n",
      "Yeah, but we should not show the trait which we are not even replying back in the active meetings list.\n",
      "So so now it is possible to be in at least at least we can have a Mapping of Zoom account to our installation earlier.\n",
      "Under under Terry the token is not permanent.\n",
      "And so those things all sorry check it out once but I bought it there yesterday and I started looking in this calendar integration.\n",
      "I just started going through the Google apis.\n",
      "But Google base is a is it looks like there is no way through kind of thing.\n",
      "Yeah, I think I think there are technical of the polling themself and they are pushing the north deficient was I will go through the EPA Google apis a little bit.\n",
      "There are ways can do push notifications also, let me let me go through the months.\n",
      "We need to create a separate email address for each and every board quickly verify that if you get set up.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "Yeah, that will be shown that will be shown here cast will be shown in the recent meetings, but we do not have any like there are no two lists, like only costs and meetings.\n",
      "Basically that if we want we can do it in the front and also\n",
      "We were not show the cast meetings, okay?\n",
      "I was looking into the Zoom app integration.\n",
      "I created a new sample app, which is like a mix of even we could based on the and what app Zoom it could be expected.\n",
      "I was able to install receive events and the able to generate the token you too.\n",
      "The one one good thing is like when we tested last time a few months back with there was no way to get the account account ID for the insulation right Zoom account ID.\n",
      "They have added it in the user list is a response.\n",
      "That is where we actually start the song.\n",
      "So we need to refuse attacking every XnumberX minutes.\n",
      "Should because it is just art free of their disappear.\n",
      "So I just want to see this Innovative.\n",
      "We can do it with a regular place.\n",
      "We need to pour the events.\n",
      "Yeah, I just had a chat with us.\n",
      "I asked him to create a mail.\n",
      "I just wanted to see if you are getting the Alias email lady.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "But is there we will get a refresh token?\n",
      "Also, if you do not get it, then like it will be huge overhead for us first.\n",
      "I am just working on a bi that address the bunch of issues right now.\n",
      "There are diversities in cases where Zoom or to summarization of failing so I fix them added deleted.\n",
      "So with the other negation that I am testing the slack connectors and the other thing is being able to unify all the basic validations at the bottom level for things like whether the bot is present in the meeting.\n",
      "Present in the room is if it is a DM and the other stuff that we commonly do for any kind of operations at from slack to compare when they are issued from commands or when we issue slack API call to create a meeting Etc.\n",
      "So there is a bunch of work to be done.\n",
      "So I am just testing the changes line on fixing some bugs and PR is that And once it is Valerie, we can merge it so that will help solve some of the bugs that we have right now with respect to Auto summarization and just handling the summer.\n",
      "But you are facing some issues right now.\n",
      "It is all working fine now.\n",
      "After removing overlapping groups\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "What do you say like run an ETL pipeline detail code for the for around a hundred graph dumps from staircase to data.\n",

      "So I am just testing the changes line on fixing some bugs and PR is that And once it is Valerie, we can merge it so that will help solve some of the bugs that we have right now with respect to Auto summarization and just handling the summer.\n",
      "But you are facing some issues right now.\n",
      "It is all working fine now.\n",
      "Checking Timerange --------------\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "So we are we are working on the what you call the then symbol for that like like them the back and model needed and then and then the processor so Shri Arjun and I are trying to work together on that to see where you know, how we can make the entity.\n",
      "You summaries for which we need a entity model, which Arjun is improving one and then mystery and I are working on experimenting with some approaches where we can aggregate this just segments or the sentences instead of going only by the segment.\n",
      "We might we will we might conclude on at least couple of approaches by by next week.\n",
      "Their communities started the summary and the under Community with summaries.\n",
      "The one that we still have in staging is do we know that is it better than what we have is Tim is in\n",
      "So that is a yes, but this communitybased approach.\n",
      "Yeah, that is one obvious observation from some of the test calls and the production calls that have seen.\n",
      "I mean, at least this way we can have more visibility even after this call.\n",
      "We might have some some insights and then we can work on it.\n",
      "So that is easy too.\n",
      "So and also the entity model it is in it is a it is in staging to so so Arjun is working with Russian to have it in our tin production.\n",
      "So there are fewer of them changes required on that path for both for both for this entity model and for sales mind.\n",
      "So there is like that there is locally now and I am like populating them with degree of bulk method and everything.\n",
      "What do you say like run an ETL pipeline detail code for the for around a hundred graph dumps from staircase to data.\n",
      "On the video staging calls if it is working fine.\n",
      "So I did not like once the pipeline is set then I will basically run need to has as part of key phrase or some other service and log d results.\n",
      "So whenever they come along with the key phases or they will be like all separate service which will check for recommended watches and then I will just log it so that I can see it.\n",
      "So right now we just take the final table type in segments.\n",
      "But so, let us see if it is enough data on.\n",
      "Now folks right now just to get an idea and I am using mind doing everything locally and just using like a hundred grams.\n",
      "Like yesterday, I was working on connecting the same is not as is breaking.\n",
      "This is not possible like using this as using it as as they can because it works almost everything in the back and it only provides the apis.\n",
      "I wanted to have my compiled version of that.\n",
      "It is like I just want like the iframe rather than the Jets image source.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Well, it works really well on few cases and then and then it just Falls flat.\n",
      "It is inconclusive actually, so it is very subjective.\n",
      "So it is really intend closes.\n",
      "So we just do not just do not have any reason to deploy it into to take it all the way to Productions.\n",
      "It is hard to verify validate even the world production.\n",
      "You know even with I will share some things that I got from today is call with action, I think.\n",
      "Itll be interesting to see what chapters gives the communities approaches by perceiving with production.\n",
      "I do not think it is worth the effort right now, honestly, unless we find something working really well.\n",
      "But even if you even if you try to compare current segments with the with the communities that we have right it is better not to proceed without without any conclusion on the current communities.\n",
      "So so sugar makes working on improvements for those things like like instead of abruptly ending the sentence like we have seen some cases.\n",
      "So we are trying to extend that a little so that you do not miss out the sentence endings, which I eventually it also depends on the transcript, but whatever can be done from our side for these are abrupt ending we can we can handle that.\n",
      "Let the subject ending at the end without like a noun phrase if there is a noun phrase with two words if we currently tend to end it with the first for itself.\n",
      "We just do not want to we have to handle it says study to go all the way to see all the it is subjects around it so that we can that is one fix that we will have it in so that you become would be testing and then we should that should improve the at least the existing action items.\n",
      "The subject should be more explainable.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Click there is no way using like customizing the UI of the Seagate we can have the knitted C library and put the all the components as lik done by the did see me people and compile our own and you further up.\n",
      "It would be the it would be that approach which we can actually can achieve what you want with that approach.\n",
      "We can compile our own version and loaded.\n",
      "saying if we In the external API code base when we compile.\n",
      "Like it is not that straight approach.\n",
      "Like if you see also did if we clone the Gypsy meet we make some modify in the did simic file when we run in the local.\n",
      "It shows all those strangers, but when you build it and give the same source to our app.\n",
      "This one is we can host their own with simic server.\n",
      "It is everything that they do on top of the Gypsy meet since you maybe if you want to go through the code base little bit and then you get instant it is better but an alternate approach could be ironic sustainable want is that do all right approach?\n",
      "It is also depends on how much knowledge you guys have on signaling on its take and how much information you know, how to Multiplex the you know, it is not the sweetest in my platoon is also and Link Network.\n",
      "The reaching meet with the other is just raise if we can know we can add a configuration disappear and emergent.\n",
      "That has the place for Distributing.\n",
      "That is one more thing.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Theyll reply like after XnumberX bleeding.\n",
      "But much more than the feel like I have recipe are and like it is take a lot of time.\n",
      "I can raise up your for that also if we can spend some time on using legitimate and mimicking or gypsum.\n",
      "It would be easier for us to fall in like the photo.\n",
      "to hide the config in a CPR Just make it high double like in the sense that option to hide the top portion.\n",
      "We are saying that you know, it is not as easy as it sounds so just letting you know think if it is easy to just provide an option like in the Json.\n",
      "We were facing a lot of issues and a lot of comments on this.\n",
      "Yeah, but from what I have tested it is not straightforward and people have said the same thing and it is not even consistent with the telling on the network errors that you see, it is Amin handles.\n",
      "That is good that we the faster we do it for now always ask for thing and it seemed to me that part.\n",
      "For the month like I just went through like it is not a stable version It is Alpha version of something and when I navigate about information, it says company Google and also the Dozer name as Firefox.\n",
      "That was the problem but\n",
      "So I think once the stable version comes with it will be buggy and it because it fails to load our application.\n",
      "We are not using it in the react app.\n",
      "So it is from the library itself one of the from one of the libraries.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "It says Firefox or something.\n",
      "And once that means was wrong then with other libraries also because it is not reaching you until our AB dot J is before that only it says undefined some binding is undefined.\n",
      "Okay, so I definitely Inspire respect of this we need to get better at capturing errors and being able to look at them differently.\n",
      "It is an undefined exception.\n",
      "So maybe you can check because I know we had but two bucks integration implemented so far we should send it if that is an exception.\n",
      "I am kind of in visited.\n",
      "Although I will just set now only and then I will proceed with the other.\n",
      "Well try and six position.\n",
      "But when I saw that I am not able to run that in the device.\n",
      "So like I am working on it and we will get to know you get on a call.\n",
      "Yeah, so like we facing this issue, so I wanted to test the upgrade in the physical device.\n",
      "So is the release version running find on the yeah the release version?\n",
      "On a local machine we are able to debug the app like run both the debug and release versions, but on the device debug version we are not able to do.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Yeah discussion yesterday fortunately could be the concept.\n",
      "Maybe you can also check with brown shade starting to work on the zoom integration limits.\n",
      "It is not or you prefer anything else.\n",
      "The cast will not be shown to anybody.\n",
      "And also it is not that does not show up in the join list like the front end in the clients.\n",
      "You can launch a WPA will support it but joining never showed.\n",
      "Yeah, you cannot in front and the other the API will support it.\n",
      "That is a record for Zoom.\n",

      "You need them to send emails to the organizer.\n",
      "So you can put your second events also was working for unexpected ones out then that I have like there is a dissipation Industries now, then there are few Sports.\n",
      "And so those things all sorry check it out once but I bought it there yesterday and I started looking in this calendar integration.\n",
      "But Google base is a is it looks like there is no way through kind of thing.\n",
      "Also we need lll go through this code.\n",
      "Under under Terry the token is not permanent.\n",
      "There are ways can do push notifications also, let me let me go through the months.\n",
      "Yeah, I think I think there are technical of the polling themself and they are pushing the north deficient was I will go through the EPA Google apis a little bit.\n",

You summaries for which we need a entity model, which Arjun is improving one and then mystery and I are working on experimenting with some approaches where we can aggregate this just segments or the sentences instead of going only by the segment. So that's still in still in progress. We might we will we might conclude on at least couple of approaches by by next week.  So that's a yes, but this community-based approach.

So we just don't just don't have any reason to deploy it into to take it all the way to Productions.  You know even with I'll share some things that I got from today's call with action, I think. It'll be interesting to see what chapters gives the communities approaches by perceiving with production. It can sometimes inconclusive like it's all again as you mentioned. It's hard to verify validate even the world production.  But even if you even if you try to compare current segments with the with the communities that we have right it's better not to proceed without without any conclusion on the current communities. Okay. I don't think it's worth the effort right now, honestly, unless we find something working really well.  Yeah.  Action item is already deployed.  Yeah action items is deployed. So so sugar makes working on improvements for those things like like instead of abruptly ending the sentence like we have seen some cases. So we are trying to extend that a little so that you don't miss out the sentence endings, which I eventually it also depends on the transcript, but whatever can be done from our side for these are abrupt ending we can we can handle that.  Let the subject ending at the end without like a noun phrase if there is a noun phrase with two words if we currently tend to end it with the first for itself. We just don't want to we have to handle it says study to go all the way to see all the it is subjects around it so that we can that's one fix that we will have it in so that you become would be testing and then we should that should improve the at least the existing action items.

I mean, at least this way we can have more visibility even after this call. We might have some some insights and then we can work on it.  So and also the entity model it's in it's a it's in staging to so so Arjun is working with Russian to have it in our tin production. So there are fewer of them changes required on that path for both for both for this entity model and for sales mind.  The Entity not just going to be called from the key free services  Yeah for now it's only for key phrase but it'll also be used for it is definitely going to be used for the communities.  VI calls independently  Shotgun update on ether graph and and the recommendations for that.  So I have thought like IO. What do you say like run an ETL pipeline detail code for the for around a hundred graph dumps from staircase to data. So there's like that there is locally now and I'm like populating them with degree of bulk method and everything.  So it's going somewhere else. I'm checking that down. So once that is done, then I'll be working on the getting setting up a complete pipeline starting from creating the these hundred grafts gums and using that data for Downstream costly recommended vultures and rated  Please sir. Once you're done, we have been used and flown. Can you try running some ways like preparing the operating system?  This is yeah.  now you give us some idea like  So I didn't like once the pipeline is set then I'll basically run need to has as part of key phrase or some other service and log d results. So right now we just take the final table type in segments. So whenever they come along with the key phases or they'll be like all separate service which will check for recommended watches and then I will just log it so that I can see it. On the video staging calls if it is working fine. And do you  That's the father and youngest daughter to me.  You studied in is three right in the same Market?  200 little maximum  You had no, it's not required right now. It's just for testing. I will just put it along with you.  Going to be entirely local database window.  Okay, no problem.  I know you're busy with the past implementation, but they want to jump in on setting up with the data Macedonia.  Yeah, so I think probably today I will be done with a Turkish changes and then I'll work on the infrastructure part for decaf I try there to ECS approach for setting of the graph instance.  Total private of liquids since station is also where I can take help from him.  I mean, it's just finish one item first if you're already looking. Okay? Okay. Meanwhile, I think it's on can still try use the currently set up saving their onlooker.  Okay.  If you want to see it again, but seriously.  Now folks right now just to get an idea and I'm using mind doing everything locally and just using like a hundred grams. But so, let's see if it's enough data on.  but  If you really want we can we still have one instance which is running the graph is not the idealistic infrastructure that we have set up.  Yeah, okay. I'll let you know.  Anything else from their writing? The salesman is already insane again. So yeah.  And I protect sales in the sales wind is and staging I tested out then if it's fine, then we'll move it to production.  Okay.  the front end  Like yesterday, I was working on connecting the same ain't as is breaking. Right? This is not possible like using this as using it as as they can because it works almost everything in the back and it only provides the apis.  Why are we doing the dictionary says be careful?  Because when we leave we should have more control over the UI.  So you're building the external API SDK not the little bit signal.  It's not like just sing it.

I see your point.  Yeah, so anything if you want to make the changes in the UI, like custom you are very should use the a little bit sing it and on top of it like building the components and having the UI and the connecting the conference and everything should follow up to Dixie need Behavior, like keeping all those architecture and everything so that we can achieve the Gypsy need benefits using lived its in it.  the only challenge with using lift its imitates lot of work to do and you  I don't have the but we'll have a code base to refer.

It is everything that they do on top of the Gypsy meet since you maybe if you want to go through the code base little bit and then you get instant it's better but an alternate approach could be ironic sustainable want is that do all right approach?

We were facing a lot of issues and a lot of comments on this. We are saying that you know, it's not as easy as it sounds so just letting you know think if it's easy to just provide an option like in the Json. to hide the config in a CPR Just make it high double like in the sense that option to hide the top portion.

So I yelled out to test it on edge.  For the month like I just went through like it's not a stable version It's Alpha version of something and when I navigate about information, it says company Google and also the Dozer name as Firefox. So I think once the stable version comes with it will be buggy and it because it fails to load our application. That was the problem but  It's using chromium.  Yeah, they're building it on. Come on.  Once the stable version comes we can check.  Is it so we can't even identify it's the latest edge browser?  I'm buying function.

Okay, so I definitely Inspire respect of this we need to get better at capturing errors and being able to look at them differently. So maybe you can check because I know we had but two bucks integration implemented so far we should send it if that is an exception. It's an undefined exception. We shouldn't be catching and just continuing without doing it.  I'm kind of in visited. Although I'll just set now only and then I'll proceed with the other.  Just checking bucks.

I was just going through some stack Overflow things know where it's mention that we can you know, add a hook so that go sense events to that.  So is it and I think the it pours and does a event was.

We still set the port access token. if it is not deleted that means there's only one set remaining which is  Hey use, the same installation access code.  And if we was all not already installed, it was never installed before then. We said customer ID to installation of customer idea, but the problem is because in else case if it is not installed customized still be empty.  Let's not find putting it in an SQL. So I took it out. I said customer identical do insulation or customer rating because it's the same thing either ways.  One of the cases it will still be empty.  Okay, in one case it will be empty because if there is no installation at all, not even one day so that time it will be empty.  Else it will not reduce insulation. So it is same as either being empty or an example. So for this put it out.  So this function I broke it down to check. Okay, if that you're using what access token and do cases that means the state is not okay, what access token with setting only one is installation is when it's not installed or it  so the more some state is not installed on the extent that  I'm still thinking that what if he has not provided board token.

Let's see.  audience  I think yeah, it's just you know.  They once you tested you just let me know then we can then I can rebase or whatever it is. Yeah mind. There are.  Here's our love Geneva III. This is getting hard so our time because I have lot of small small commits that I have built up.  What happens is when I rebates it goes supplies on top of every commit and have the kids.  I just take the current development mode it to my Visa bans because all the comments in one shot and then merge it back to dollar.  You do get it much. Okay, okay.  So I had the problem I think last time also because I generally keep small small combats with more descriptive anymore what's changing but I have a lot of comment generally in a feature Branch. So when I went everywhere be in a very committed I'm getting rebates or acts like conflicts. Correct? Pretty much resolve all the commit history in my teacher, but who did much develop that means from a feature branch? I was at the other Branch into my feature Branch resolve the conflicts in one shot and then  one more coming  As a magic away, that's the most common and then feature branch is resolved. So then the dimension we March back.  A lot of people say it's better because you don't know destructive editing. That means you're not changing the commit history because of rebase and just try to avoid the next recommend impossible. That's one of the better side.  But at some point you can still do it gets crash, right?  We can squash the question is do squash after the reviewer before the so for me I prefer to people to see like small small keep committing incrementally. So people see the changes so I don't squash before.  Better you must because a lot of code changes exact similar file similar lines.  reading in the museum  Yeah, yeah - inter-korea have to commit symbol.  And also like it'll help you because I'm screwing some of the checks and validation if you need it. Anyways, neither.  I understand that. Barbara Nation I do with all entry points and disaster man and the book meeting. We're headed for a wherever board level validation is required because you can go lower already clicked a civilization bottle variation. We need to do meeting you can do beating neural.

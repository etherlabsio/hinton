So he's improving on top of it for ether like Eustace and then whereas SRI and I are experimenting with the entities versus the key phrases to keep it simple is the current key phrase. I was how do we marry them? And it is no different from Key phrases if you So for for example for our workspace DeLorean might be an entity which space he would never give so we are trying to make make the entity recognition model it nuances of any work space let it is part of okay. \n",

So if for any task if you can always insist that you pay program, that means you sit together design the task together take up. It is what together review each other's code, right?

      "But from what I understand is just one more additional.\n",
      "We want actual more shree.\n",
      "What else is there?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You notice that the definitely come up so that is why so once we roll out this and then and then if you see if you see what we are missing, we will just need to finetune it so, okay, okay.\n",
      "It is what together review each other is code, right?\n",
      "That is probably the it is probably what we need if we can plan and work accordingly, that will be great.\n",
      "That is what I am looking to right now.\n",
      "Yeah, if you can just reset it, thatll be good.\n",
      "Just so we keep about it.\n",
      "It has to be strong enough so that it can be recommended.\n",
      "wants to go first\n",
      "I will\n",
      "So we just\n",
      "So we will keep you updated.\n",
      "But as of now we are experimenting on this.\n",
      "How are we and who is working on?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "So these two are not not so separable.\n",
      "I was how do we marry them?\n",
      "So\n",
      "All right seven.\n",
      "It works like that.\n",
      "Actually.\n",
      "I will see how they are performing it.\n",
      "it is happening and\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "She will not listen.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "We should just stick to what we have right now.\n",
      "I am just\n",
      "Like simple fixed.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I will not start working on it.\n",
      "I will just stop.\n",
      "Yeah, okay.\n",
      "So then that is fine.\n",
      "I am good with it.\n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "They going to rewrite this again.\n",
      "Anything else to add?\n",

      "Structured format of summary we can just display that in the UA also they can the clients also.\n",
      "Once it is once the Lambda is available social could replace Spacey with this entity model.\n",
      "The idea is that we do want, you know, we have so far been like implementing a lot of features.\n",

      "So it is all consensus peso a single entity has to be, you know in the graph.\n",
      "After entities, I think if you have to segregate, right, so we are trying to marry this entity recognition with the key phrase service that we currently have trying to map across the meetings.\n",
      "So one prime difference is that when we run it on staging to we might we are not seeing consistent results.\n",
      "That is because of their transcript and then the model is very sensitive to the grammar unlike other other services.\n",
      "I think we can I think we are good to go to at least have it enabled in a workspace production unless you have any concerns on that.\n",
      "I think we can run some more tests to just do some postprocessing tricks, which we cannot do right now because anything that we do might not or might work for the shorter context of what we are looking for.\n",
      "We have we have been doing key experiments on bringing together the current communities which is like the question similarity featurebased to the key phrases and entity graphs that we are doing so we are still early to to show any results.\n",
      "On creating a custom entity recognition model and Sheree and I are working on combining this with the current keyphrase extraction service to find out ways to argument the the current Community approach.\n",

      "So there it is like a gray area.\n",
      "So come between at least if you keep the current feeforservice aside, which will run as is unless we unless we decide to change something what what we among SRI Arjun and myself what we are trying to do is to To solve this as a whole as a whole problem.\n",
      "That means Arjun is trying to make the entity recognition, which is the key for this service to this trying to improve on top of it.\n",
      "We currently have our own entity recognition, which is an alternative for Spacey.\n",
      "And it is no different from Key phrases if you So for for example for our workspace DeLorean might be an entity which space he would never give so we are trying to make make the entity recognition model it nuances of any work space let it is part of okay.\n",
      "But what what we have parallel doing this to to working on replacing the space entities with the car with the entity recognition model that we have already Arjun has already created a Lambda service for that.\n",
      "That means we have we have a custom entity model.\n",
      "Entity match between the users and then start recommending.\n",
      "But it in when we upgrade our we just upgrading the library or we are also using any of the new features that is available in the newer versions.\n",
      "Maybe just like as I mentioned produces a XnumberX millisecond or XnumberX millisecond delay between our pushers so that at least it is sort of guarantee some order but it is very hard to enforce it before we can do.\n",
      "The only thing will be that if we are planning to cut go to the new format, which is topic highlight actions.\n",
      "Okay, then let us make sure that whatever we are doing which is breaking it up into three parts ensuring that each part does an acrylic see three thousand whatever characters are words.\n",
      "So the new improvements include like we will send the cells contain segments.\n",
      "I suppose there is a breakage in segments like in the in the sentence then we combine the previous segment sentence.\n",
      "cluster =========>\n",
      "So people have been working independently, but now I think I would like to insist that there is a greater kind of color, you know, crossfunctional learning Collaborative Learning that happens.\n",
      "Productions Guy wanted a system.\n",
      "Yeah, so if you do it for our dogs play work space.\n",
      "So he is improving on top of it for ether like Eustace and then whereas SRI and I are experimenting with the entities versus the key phrases to keep it simple is the current key phrase.\n",
      "So like yesterday, we are created like a milestone for November for like content team.\n",

      "So I have added lakhs for it as well so that we can debug XnumberX will need like so frontend team and Franklin like if we can do this test like around five calls with multiple participants and we can do a couple of tests like living by just closing the tab instead of like clicking on the exit button so that like will\n",

      "Today, we are not getting locked bug snack.\n",
      "Extra Care should be done or any support iOS and web we have that issue.\n",
      "The is like thinking like should I continue on summary survey?\n",
      "Let is push it to production and then come back for structured summary population is at or what which one is the private older Cree like at least the past display part?\n",
      "Confused see if it is if the current summary that is in production.\n",
      "And reformatted the new summary.\n",
      "The world way as it is.\n",
      "Will that continue or when the next time we push something production?\n",
      "They currently we are sending a single segment for Action at action.\n",
      "Verify if it is self contained only then we pass on to the cell action detection.\n",

      "What is the next course of action is basically to understand who maybe has better.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "I think we can I think we are good to go to at least have it enabled in a workspace production unless you have any concerns on that.\n",
      "So one prime difference is that when we run it on staging to we might we are not seeing consistent results.\n",
      "That is because of their transcript and then the model is very sensitive to the grammar unlike other other services.\n",
      "On creating a custom entity recognition model and Sheree and I are working on combining this with the current keyphrase extraction service to find out ways to argument the the current Community approach.\n",
      "We have we have been doing key experiments on bringing together the current communities which is like the question similarity featurebased to the key phrases and entity graphs that we are doing so we are still early to to show any results.\n",
      "Right one is identifying the communities within a con within a call and then within that Community extracting good key phrases.\n",
      "So there it is like a gray area.\n",
      "And it is no different from Key phrases if you So for for example for our workspace DeLorean might be an entity which space he would never give so we are trying to make make the entity recognition model it nuances of any work space let it is part of okay.\n",
      "So come between at least if you keep the current feeforservice aside, which will run as is unless we unless we decide to change something what what we among SRI Arjun and myself what we are trying to do is to To solve this as a whole as a whole problem.\n",
      "We currently have our own entity recognition, which is an alternative for Spacey.\n",
      "So for the for the one that we currently plan these store interval when so unless a community would be good only if there are enough keep only there are reliable key phrases.\n",
      "That means Arjun is trying to make the entity recognition, which is the key for this service to this trying to improve on top of it.\n",
      "But what what we have parallel doing this to to working on replacing the space entities with the car with the entity recognition model that we have already Arjun has already created a Lambda service for that.\n",
      "That means we have we have a custom entity model.\n",
      "Once it is once the Lambda is available social could replace Spacey with this entity model.\n",
      "But one one unanimous observation is it is it is way better than Spacey because space is very sensitive to the casing of the conversation which we do not properly get in Google.\n",
      "So which means Pacey is naturally not a good fit so that way against we are so many entities out of card.\n",
      "But we will still get all the common entities right like organizations and whatever right like all those sorts of things.\n",
      "After entities, I think if you have to segregate, right, so we are trying to marry this entity recognition with the key phrase service that we currently have trying to map across the meetings.\n",
      "Entity match between the users and then start recommending.\n",
      "So it is all consensus peso a single entity has to be, you know in the graph.\n",
      "But it in when we upgrade our we just upgrading the library or we are also using any of the new features that is available in the newer versions.\n",
      "We wanted to do Action Service.\n",
      "Structured format of summary we can just display that in the UA also they can the clients also.\n",
      "Maybe just like as I mentioned produces a XnumberX millisecond or XnumberX millisecond delay between our pushers so that at least it is sort of guarantee some order but it is very hard to enforce it before we can do.\n",
      "Then let us resolve that so that we are consistently seeing, you know, improvements and then we can go on to the next thing.\n",
      "Staging we have the new strategy of community Pimm is.\n",
      "The only thing will be that if we are planning to cut go to the new format, which is topic highlight actions.\n",
      "Okay, then let us make sure that whatever we are doing which is breaking it up into three parts ensuring that each part does an acrylic see three thousand whatever characters are words.\n",
      "--------------\n",
      "Yeah, so if you do it for our dogs play work space.\n",
      "I guess if we talk about say Google and webrtc in the skull, you will try to match that with other meetings are all the to them.\n",
      "So I have added lakhs for it as well so that we can debug XnumberX will need like so frontend team and Franklin like if we can do this test like around five calls with multiple participants and we can do a couple of tests like living by just closing the tab instead of like clicking on the exit button so that like will\n",
      "It seems like for this call also like we have not done any production deployment since Friday, but it is switching properly and I have added locks for the active speaker switch so that in case if that issue comes back again will be will be able to debug that and we have also added so yesterday when we were testing like a few random meetings were were not ending and participants seems to be like so when we leave like in the quarter one of the participant would not leave like it would just show a blank feel like a black fee, but it would not get updated.\n",
      "So like I guess Pasha is working on lazy loading and providerbased something and like I have start I in one he has now started with breeding react and react native versions.\n",

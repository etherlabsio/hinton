Now go ahead, open up your favorite.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Start changing and try to look up for What is it?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The people who are already using the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But the people who do not understand the FBI, we need to target at people.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You need to make sure that they understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me give you a quick example, and I will give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation, bored very quickly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"See how the Dbms Family evolved with time the following diagram shows the evolution of DBMs categories.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that is I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So varies all how and maybe tell the I will try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You might want to initialize that feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Fine on that framework Microsoft is finished huge amount of time in researching on using microsoft framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They started it right from Nineteen ninety six.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"dinner and these containers are the absolute heart off the Docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers wrap up your entire code on these are absolutely portable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is both absolute charm off the Docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now we can dig this container and bay where you are going to put this country that it is gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the clasic example is, whenever you are learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not talking about the GHB Paschal package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the score, my as. Cuba.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody is running Windows, Mac and violence.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Theyre super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"He is the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you are running from the networking information that you are running.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something is in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a client side application program.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And you do not have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker also act as a social networking.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The parent the machine learning is behind all while things like tagging objects and people inside of photos or clarity machine learning like it may help be immediately apparent that recommending the next video watch is it also power machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These two pieces broadly the outline the two sides machine learning both of them be important using data is what we were refer to as train well same license is referred to as making predictions or inputs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now let us grow into those two side frequent for a little bit training refers to use to inform the creation and Python of a predictive model this predictive model can then be used to server position.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe four search engine may be producing moving Docker XnumberX logger inside of them features.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now we also know that there is one of the very important people who live to sign in peach.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So one of the code feature is an organ system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, although this enttled code is written by the Google, but I do not have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"How am I even provide new features?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now there is one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"the example of the guy is very simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let us say you want to fly from Jeff.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are looking from the third party Web site, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let us want over animation section and give you an example that you are already using off the idea.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now let us try to understand what is this A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"and we are gonna use a simple example that you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Some of you might have already beat.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me bring up my own website here.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"He used a kind of a feature known a sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I thought, this sign of features pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just registered in your name, email address, pasport and then I send you information even at your email and use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let us bring up Google that side.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Credit so in session and what is net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was July like two thousand when bill gates up period in a B d C with stands of process develop conference in our line of data where be that we have uploaded it now and we call it microsoft dot net framework like Microsoft dot net easily was named as n G w U S, which stands for next generation windows service, but Microsoft is marketing team later around named it as startup.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is not This is your A.P.I.. Now, there is no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is the simplest thing in the world.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"is just a code written by someone else that I do not really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circmstances would have bean that what these people have written this code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And I can use that in my application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"For example, logging into this Google are logging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any satellite into the space.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything is and going on there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the XnumberX eyes now, some of the FBI is are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Django will is a freak here that you can use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if you are going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we will talk about the fire ways in some other movies on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is forget about all that thing in.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming running languages, which required two different core managers libraries and sometimes.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as you you happen to have this basic and installed in your computer system and you have a paradigm time manage and the total window and it goes on and on and on the more language.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you bio in your computer system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now would not it be great if you just happen to have only one set a run time funds set of library very and one single and deal with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint and start there and lost, but not the least Docker is also a complete That does not manage all of this for you know, as I promised in the start of the video, I have not shared some of the person expedience with the dog as well, So here we go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Be sure Buck again with the video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And in this video we are gonna talk about Docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The first and the only gold we will be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Are four major types of Dbms let us look into them in detail hierarchical.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMs employs the parent child relationship of storing data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMs is rarely used nowadays is structured like a tree with notes representing records and branches representing fields.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The windows registry used in windows is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with Nodes network dbMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMS supports many to many relationships.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This usually result complex database structures server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relation dBMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMs defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Unlike the network B M s our dBms does now support many to many relationships relational dBMs usually have pre defined data types that they can support.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is the most popular dBMs type in the market examples of relational database management systems include Oracle and microsoft SQL server object oriented relational dBMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type support stories of new data types that data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that define what to do with the data host green SQL L is an example of object oriented relational dBMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Seen data and answer the clients and data gathered the model to be improved time and new predictive models deployed as you may have noticed the key component of this entire process is data everything hinges on data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yeah guys can to Unbox the machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, that problem is whenever you are designing a project, it was absolutely fine in your machine, the developer machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody is else computer.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your friends are maybe a manager.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Although here we are talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe the palace is a little bit different.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the clasic problem is it works on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This further brings the clasic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it is compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Come to this tutorial series on SQL and database, but before we learn about database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is understand what is data in simple words dating could be facts related to an object in consideration for example, your name age height weight etcetera are some data related to you and pictures.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as sequel is actually this standard language for dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does not mean SQL cannot do things beyond on that in fact it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like oracle Ms SQL Sai etcetera use SQL SQL syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different and even proprietary SQL an example of an SQL statement selected star from members where age is greater than thirty DBMs stands for database management system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most widely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It uses SQL as the standard query language sQL is the standard language used to query a database the database approach has many advantages when it comes to storing data compared to the traditional flat file based systems.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Same work is not a new industry usually frameworks are not designed with the visa that from white of old for common functionality in industry.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are so many frameworks around which are providing first from challenges support to build enterprise sections.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now what my microsoft simple test is just doing this similar thing what another framework does so a adopted framework is also consisting of life valleys and clases, which are designed to achieve a common code across various type of applications when in Microsoft challenge rates.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if you want to understand a bit more about framework work.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Then have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer which just sitting between your operating system and dot net compliant programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Microsoft framework is a software earlier layer which says the business studio view and operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is supports many two running languages as a framework is supposed to do are supposed to provide common functionality across different type of application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft docment Framework in public and it evolved.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you the why dot was fairly needed what purpose it is a strongly in industry if you know about C or programming languages or even then basic financial of these two from our languages C users has include S p I or downs to perform and Jeff and the scanning functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Similarly C does is as soon type of programming running language with object to date framework edit and it uses dot these two languages are almost same they perform same type of functionality, but they have to just in type of some time environment they have two different set of libraries on together two different from two different management techniques and so on means if you have my specific type of application moving to owned it can using C or it can be told up using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with or interacting with two different runtime environment and do this and code credentials.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now what is a data database we already know what data is, but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is a database management system DBMs database management system or DBMs is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also helps control access to the database by various users.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a dBMS to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data etcetera.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisnts and a lot more.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of DBMS database management systems are not a new concept and as such has been first implemented in the nineteen sixties Charles docments integrated data store or d is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a aligned while usage and unexpected functional of databases have been increased immensely types of DBMs M s.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"World it is filled with data a lot of data pictures music words spreadsheets videos and it does not look like it is going to slow down any anytime soon machine learning brings the promise of driving me all of that partners further famously once said any sufficiently that technology is in this individual from that I found not to be magic rather and technology and you can utilize and answer questions with your data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is cloud aI makers my name did you label well and each episode we will be exploring the art science and tools from machine learning along the way we will see just how easy it is to create a meeting experiences and your valuable insights the value of machine learning is on just beginning to show itself.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is a lot of data in the world today generated not only by people but also by computers phones and other devices this will only continue to grow and the years call traditionally humans have alyzed data and adapted systems to the changes the patterns.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"However, that is the volume of data suggestion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The ability humans makes sense of it and manually write those rules we will turn and increase so automate automated like a third data and importantly the changes in data to adapt to a shifting landscape.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We see machine learning all around the product view.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Perhaps the biggest example of all is Google search every time you use Google search you are using a system as machine learning system that core from understanding the text of your query to adjusting the results based on your first interests such as knowing which results to when searching for Java depending anyhow whether you are a copy expert or developer.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Perhaps your both today machine learning immediate applications are already quite white ranging including recognition fraud detection and recommendation systems as well as texts each systems too being powerful capabilities can we apply to a wide range fields from and skin cancer detection to retail and of course in the form of self parking and self vehicles.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was not that long ago that want a company or product and machine learning in a offerings.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"He was considered novel now and my company is visiting to use machine learning and their products in some way it is rapidly becoming well an expect feature trust as we expect companies that have a website that works on your mobile device or perhaps I have a the day was come when it will be expected that our technology will be personalized and staple and self correcting as we use machine learning to make human tasks that are faster than before we can also look further into the future while machine learning can help us to test that we never could achieved on our own.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not hard to take advantage of machine learning today.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The Toy has gotten quite good all you need is data developers and a willingness to take the punch for our purposes.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I sure the definition machine learning gestures five words using data to answer questions while would not use that a short answer for an profile exam.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It serves a useful purpose for us asume in particular we can split the definition into two parts using data and ask for

They research that wire user tests the list goes on and off if you're new to the game this can all feel very overwhelming well throw that here out the window because we're about to embark on a journey through the sixteenth end of the UX design process that before starting any successful uX project you'll need to be in tune with two things your user in your brain. I start with the user big question around this is what problems are they making once you can identify the problem, then you can begin to start working to towards the solution second is understanding the brain and how does the project you're are working on aligned with the branch mission and goal to summarize in this stage you wanna identify the problems facing the users as well as the core goals of the brand and see how they along as a designer you probably have a gun of a*sumptions about what the user wants or doesn't want but not challenging those a*sumptions channel. If you want to hold that's two people dig yourself out on one on one interviews focus groups surveys and usability ask few methods to how bet your a*sumptions base them on real tangible evidence and keep mind you don't need a survey a million users a good rule of thumb is finding three to five users in your target audience they'll save you time and typically give you as much data as you need to move forward with your project. Now that you've done your research you can take all our data and start working with it one way to lay out your research visually as with a user persona. So as will act as a guy when it comes to making all of your design to say if you ever get stuck you can always look back to the Brazil to figure out the users need and if you need a wider view of the big picture journey that your users take try a user journey app creating a user journey map can help you understand what the users will be going through when they interact with your product or.\",\n",

I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature. \",\n",

This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food. \",\n",

In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place.

      " Text:  everyone they share back again. Now, in this video, even talk about what is A.P.I. are also on this application. Programming Integration. Now, this is a very common Adam Bay you spent on. It is a problem in our society or a computer society. Begin zero f with people understand that some trick or not, we just wanted to be technically correct. So if you look up for the A.P.I. destination on any platform Wikipedia block, they are technically correct. That's one part, but they're not so much understandable. So in this video, we're going to make sure that you understand A.P.I. what is A.P.I.? And after watching this video, you never, ever watch any video on A.P.I. or block because you will be understanding each and every bit off idea. So let's get started. Let's talk about what is A.P.I.. Now go ahead, open up your favorite. Start changing and try to look up for What is it? Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here. A.P.I.. What is it? A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system. Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle. That means we don't get it. What disease Yet? The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I. will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point. Understand? Here's the problem. The people who are already using the A.P.I. I don't mean to understand. What is it? Yeah, because they know about it. But the people who don't understand the FBI, we need to target at people. You need to make sure that they understand. So let me give you a quick example, and I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation, bored very quickly. the example of the guy is very simple. Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping. I remember the example. This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.  Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes. Maybe four search engine may be producing moving Docker 84 logger inside of them features. Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.  Hey, no problem at all. I'll give you a A.P.I. key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I. key works. So yes, that is it. This isn't This is your A.P.I.. Now, there's no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area. It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging. The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I. off Facebook and Google on. You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark. I'm not gonna put any satellite into the space. And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there. Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards. She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that's I can use that API that would be much more important. So varies all how and maybe tell the I'll try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language. You might want to initialize that feature. get everyone. Be sure Buck again with the video. And in this video we're gonna talk about Docker. After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you. And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me. So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed. The first and the only gold we'll be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem. Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem. So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve. never, never, never develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time. Markers. Well, that problem is whenever you're designing a project, it was absolutely fine in your machine, the developer machine. But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody's else computer. Maybe your friends are maybe a manager. This computer. In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place. Although here we're talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum. Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net. Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly. Maybe the palace is a little bit different. All glitchy and solve these cases. That is a cla*sic example. When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place. It doesn't work like that. So the cla*sic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the cla*sic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check. And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.  dinner and these containers are the absolute heart off the Docker. These containers wrap up your entire code on these are absolutely portable. The portability is both absolute charm off the Docker. Now we can dig this container and bay where you're going to put this country that it's gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine. Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb. Well, the cla*sic example is, whenever you're learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging. I'm not talking about the GHB Paschal package. I'm talking about just the score, my a*s. Cuba. It's one of the most challenging thing. Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody's running Windows, Mac and violence. It's not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer. So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container. They're super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks. He's the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you're running from the networking information that you're running. And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something's in your code. So in order. Summarize. Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you. Number one thing. It's a client side application program. You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking.  \n",

      " Text:  Microsoft doc*ment Framework in public and it evolved. Ideas into about Microsoft Chartered framework. Let me help you the why dot was fairly needed what purpose it is a strongly in industry if you know about C or programming languages or even then basic financial of these two from our languages C users has include S p I or downs to perform and Jeff and the scanning functionality. Similarly C does is as soon type of programming running language with object to date framework edit and it uses dot these two languages are almost same they perform same type of functionality, but they have to just in type of some time environment they have two different set of libraries on together two different from two different management techniques and so on means if you have my specific type of application moving to owned it can using C or it can be told up using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with or interacting with two different runtime environment and do this and code credentials. Is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming running languages, which required two different core managers libraries and sometimes. So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages. Now as you you happen to have this basic and installed in your computer system and you have a paradigm time manage and the total window and it goes on and on and on the more language. If you bio in your computer system. Now wouldn't it be great if you just happen to have only one set a run time funds set of library very and one single and deal with programming languages. Credit so in session and what is net framework. It was July like two thousand when bill gates up period in a B d C with stands of process develop conference in our line of data where be that we have uploaded it now and we call it microsoft dot net framework like Microsoft dot net easily was named as n G w U S, which stands for next generation windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later around named it as startup. Same work is not a new industry usually frameworks aren't designed with the visa that from white of old for common functionality in industry. There are so many frameworks around which are providing first from challenges support to build enterprise sections. Now what my microsoft simple test is just doing this similar thing what another framework does so a adopted framework is also consisting of life valleys and cla*ses, which are designed to achieve a common code across various type of applications when in Microsoft challenge rates. Now if you want to understand a bit more about framework work. Then have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer which just sitting between your operating system and dot net compliant programming languages. So Microsoft framework is a software earlier layer which says the business studio view and operating system. It's supports many two running languages as a framework is supposed to do are supposed to provide common functionality across different type of application. Come to this tutorial series on SQL and database, but before we learn about database. Let's understand what is data in simple words dating could be facts related to an object in consideration for example, your name age height weight etcetera are some data related to you and pictures. Can all be considered data. Now what is a data database we already know what data is, but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy. What is a database management system DBMs database management system or DBMs is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a dBMS to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data etcetera. Let's consider the Facebook. It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertis***nts and a lot more. We can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of DBMS database management systems are not a new concept and as such has been first implemented in the nineteen sixties Charles doc*ments integrated data store or d is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a aligned while usage and unexpected functional of databases have been increased immensely types of DBMs M s. \n",

It doesn't work like that. So the cla*sic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the cla*sic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check. And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.  dinner and these containers are the absolute heart off the Docker. These containers wrap up your entire code on these are absolutely portable. The portability is both absolute charm off the Docker. Now we can dig this container and bay where you're going to put this country that it's gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine. Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb. Well, the cla*sic example is, whenever you're learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging. I'm not talking about the GHB Paschal package. I'm talking about just the score, my a*s. Cuba. It's one of the most challenging thing. Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody's running Windows, Mac and violence. It's not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer. So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container. They're super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks. He's the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you're running from the networking information that you're running. And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something's in your code. So in order. Summarize. Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you. Number one thing. It's a client side application program. You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking.  I'm just like you share anything. You can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint and start there and lost, but not the least Docker is also a complete That doesn't manage all of this for you know, as I promised in the start of the video, I haven't shared some of the person expedience with the dog as well, So here we go. I've been talking about. Why Dark net and what is darkness. This is a very interesting and that Spacy question which people need to understand about Microsoft Dark Knight framework. \n",

      " Text:  World it is filled with data a lot of data pictures music words spreadsheets videos and it doesn't look like it's going to slow down any anytime soon machine learning brings the promise of driving me all of that partners further famously once said any sufficiently that technology is in this individual from that I found not to be magic rather and technology and you can utilize and answer questions with your data. This is cloud aI makers my name did you label well and each episode we will be exploring the art science and tools from machine learning along the way we'll see just how easy it is to create a meeting experiences and your valuable insights the value of machine learning is on just beginning to show itself. There's a lot of data in the world today generated not only by people but also by computers phones and other devices this will only continue to grow and the years call traditionally humans have a**lyzed data and adapted systems to the changes the patterns. However, that's the volume of data suggestion. The ability humans makes sense of it and manually write those rules we will turn and increase so automate automated like a third data and importantly the changes in data to adapt to a shifting landscape. We see machine learning all around the product view. The parent the machine learning is behind all while things like tagging objects and people inside of photos or clarity machine learning like it may help be immediately apparent that recommending the next video watch is it also power machine. Perhaps the biggest example of all is Google search every time you use Google search you're using a system as machine learning system that core from understanding the text of your query to adjusting the results based on your first interests such as knowing which results to when searching for Java depending anyhow whether you're a copy expert or developer. Perhaps your both today machine learning immediate applications are already quite white ranging including recognition fraud detection and recommendation systems as well as texts each systems too being powerful capabilities can we apply to a wide range fields from and skin cancer detection to retail and of course in the form of self parking and self vehicles. It wasn't that long ago that want a company or product and machine learning in a offerings. He was considered novel now and my company is visiting to use machine learning and their products in some way it's rapidly becoming well an expect feature trust as we expect companies that have a website that works on your mobile device or perhaps I have a the day was come when it will be expected that our technology will be personalized and staple and self correcting as we use machine learning to make human tasks that are faster than before we can also look further into the future while machine learning can help us to test that we never could achieved on our own. Thankfully. It's not hard to take advantage of machine learning today. The Toy has gotten quite good all you need is data developers and a willingness to take the punch for our purposes. I sure the definition machine learning gestures five words using data to answer questions while wouldn't use that a short answer for an profile exam. It serves a useful purpose for us a*sume in particular we can split the definition into two parts using data and ask for questions. \n",

they share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now in this video we will talk about what is a pi or also known as application programming interface.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, this is a very common term very useful term.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But there is a problem with our society or our computer Society be give XnumberXfXnumberX, whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I will give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it is the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it is explain not where it not rain so as twenty start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going put a set up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i is now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Everyone they share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is a pi or also known as Catholic.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website legislate you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let us try to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who is selfpromotion?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now this sign of feature is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot a lot a lot of code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is tons of features on the Google Now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there is a problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key, so,.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So then the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docments integrated data store or IDS is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a lot while usage and expected functionalities of databases have been increased immensely types of dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In dot net Framework became public and it wont.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey there, everyone thinks you are back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the core MySQL.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That was somebody is running Windows Mac and Linux.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not an easy process to do.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you are running and in some of the special cases.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you do not have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some Alton is uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"See how the Dbms Family evolved with time the following diagram shows the evolution of DBMs categories.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Get into more details about dot net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help understand why dot net framework was necessarily needed what purpose it is whole in industry if you know about C or just programming languages or email very basic fundamental of these two programming running languages C users has include s or edge to perform the test and the kind functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Similarly C toss is a similar type of programming language with object to take framework in it and it uses on Io o dot these two languages are almost saying the from same type of functionality, but they have to different type of some time in what they have two different set of libraries altogether two and sometimes time management techniques and so on means if you have a type of application to be developed it can be new and feel or it can be developed using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with all interacting with new different from time environment and two send code windows.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming languages which require tradition code editors libraries and runtime.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, I assume you happen to have Visual Basic installed in your computer system and you have a third run time environment and the third code editor window and it goes on and on and on the more number of languages you pile up in your computer system.Now would not it be great if you just happen to have only one set of runtime one set of library and one single Editor to deal with programming languages.How Microsoft solved it let us have a look at that.So Inception and what is dotnet framework?.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was July XnumberX when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for nextgeneration Windows service, but Microsoft is marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Basics of Docker like in the comments section then I interested in and some the tutorials on the target that will get you quickly up and running with the topic yeah, I I a lot daughter there is no, I absolutely up the and one of the most important thing about this video in case you are near here hit that subscribe bton and I am gonna surely catch you in the next video to then get writing a anything code and join me one to bye bye this think and just take or has.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C, you know, it is a nightmare because C is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Starting a hello world in the grow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will share the link in the description below.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It says hello Crow and it is almost XnumberX months old but still works absolutely like a chance.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in case you are interested in that, I will post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Come to this tutorial series on SQL and database.But before we learn about database, let us understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In simple words data can be faxed related to any object and consideration.For example, your name age height weight Etc are some data related to you a picture image file PDF Etc can all be considered data now moved in one database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We already know what data is but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is a database management system dbms database management system or dbms is a collection of programs which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also helps control access to the database by various users.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management.System to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Your electricity service provider is obviously using a dbms to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data Etc.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisements and a lot more we can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of dbms.Database Management systems are not A New Concept and as such had been first implemented in the XnumberXs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is look into them in detail hierarchical this type of dbms employs the parentchild relationship of storing data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of dbms is rarely used nowadays is structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields.The Windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes Network dbms.This type of dbms supports many to many relationships this usually results in complex database structures RDM server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of dbms defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations unlike the network dbms rdbms does not support many to many relationships relational dbms usually have predefined data types that they can support.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is the most popular dbms type in the market examples of relational database Management Systems include MySQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.Objectoriented relational dbms this type support storage of new data types the data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that Define what to do with the data postgresql is an example of objectoriented relational dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Off the spent huge amount of time in Researching on producing microsoft.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They started it right from Nineteen ninety six.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be talking about why dotnet and what is dotnet.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is a very interesting and very basic question, which people need to understand about microsoft.net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Paul we will understand why dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as sequel is actually the standard language were dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does not mean SQL cannot do things beyond that in fact it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like SQL oracle Ms SQL side etcetera use SQL sQl syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different and even proprietary SQL an example of an SQL statement selected star from members where age is greater than thirty DBMs stands for database management system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most wisely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It uses SQL as the standard query language sQL is the standard language used to query a database the database approach has many advantages when it comes to storing data compared to the traditional flat file based systems.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Sharp dot net C dot net and F. These are four microsoft provided dot net compliance languages by dot net compliance thailand that the languages which can target dot net framework work and can compile and execute on dot net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"With a vision that they provide support for common functionalities in Industry.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are so many Frameworks around which are providing infrastructure and support to build Enterprise applications.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is doing the similar thing what our normal framework does so a.net framework is also consisting of libraries and classes which are designed to achieve a common goal across various type of applications within Microsoft territory.Know if you want to understand a little bit more about framework than have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer, which is sitting between your operating system and Dot are compliant programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it is supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is a very interesting thing normally people understand that only C sharp or vb.net supports dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Whereas Visual Studio by default provides for programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are many other programming languages which are nonmicrosoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you want to know more about those programming languages, please go to the URL www dot dot net languages dot net and when you go to this website, you will see an image like this and this image shows all the supported languages, which can Target dotnet today.What is the purpose of this thing assume you have an application written in Kabul, which is a legacy application and you want to interact with a newly established system, which is running on dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how these two systems can communicate the COBOL code can be easily converted into Kabul dotnet and then these two programming languages or these two applications can talk to each other seamlessly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is API or also known as application programming interface.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, this is a very common term very useful term, but there is a problem with our society or our computer Society we give.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"FXnumberX whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Ill give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo selfpromotion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbojumbo with the API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Been looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments of comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with a JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and every one comment so that I can get the topic of the next video pretty simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well so that I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey, did everyone thinks you are back again with another video?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I do not really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"All I care about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I am not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going to put a satellite up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is some of the part is free for the Firebase and we will talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And that is it now sometime in that application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Heiner and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not talking about the PHP mask.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Heller and developer develops any product there are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some alternate uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other

simple now EPA is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it is the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it is explain not where it not rain so as twenty start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going put a set up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i is now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Everyone they share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is a pi or also known as Catholic.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website legislate you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let us try to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who is selfpromotion?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now this sign of feature is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot a lot a lot of code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is tons of features on the Google Now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there is a problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key, so,.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So then the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docments integrated data store or IDS is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a lot while usage and expected functionalities of databases have been increased immensely types of dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In dot net Framework became public and it wont.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey there, everyone thinks you are back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the core MySQL.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That was somebody is running Windows Mac and Linux.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not an easy process to do.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you are running and in some of the special cases.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you do not have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some Alton is uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"See how the Dbms Family evolved with time the following diagram shows the evolution of DBMs categories.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Get into more details about dot net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help understand why dot net framework was necessarily needed what purpose it is whole in industry if you know about C or just programming languages or email very basic fundamental of these two programming running languages C users has include s or edge to perform the test and the kind functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Similarly C toss is a similar type of programming language with object to take framework in it and it uses on Io o dot these two languages are almost saying the from same type of functionality, but they have to different type of some time in what they have two different set of libraries altogether two and sometimes time management techniques and so on means if you have a type of application to be developed it can be new and feel or it can be developed using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with all interacting with new different from time environment and two send code windows.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming languages which require tradition code editors libraries and runtime.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, I assume you happen to have Visual Basic installed in your computer system and you have a third run time environment and the third code editor window and it goes on and on and on the more number of languages you pile up in your computer system.Now would not it be great if you just happen to have only one set of runtime one set of library and one single Editor to deal with programming languages.How Microsoft solved it let us have a look at that.So Inception and what is dotnet framework?.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was July XnumberX when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for nextgeneration Windows service, but Microsoft is marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Basics of Docker like in the comments section then I interested in and some the tutorials on the target that will get you quickly up and running with the topic yeah, I I a lot daughter there is no, I absolutely up the and one of the most important thing about this video in case you are near here hit that subscribe bton and I am gonna surely catch you in the next video to then get writing a anything code and join me one to bye bye this think and just take or has.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C, you know, it is a nightmare because C is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Starting a hello world in the grow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will share the link in the description below.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It says hello Crow and it is almost XnumberX months old but still works absolutely like a chance.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in case you are interested in that, I will post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Come to this tutorial series on SQL and database.But before we learn about database, let us understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In simple words data can be faxed related to any object and consideration.For example, your name age height weight Etc are some data related to you a picture image file PDF Etc can all be considered data now moved in one database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We already know what data is but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is a database management system dbms database management system or dbms is a collection of programs which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also helps control access to the database by various users.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management.System to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Your electricity service provider is obviously using a dbms to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data Etc.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisements and a lot more we can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of dbms.Database Management systems are not A New Concept and as such had been first implemented in the XnumberXs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is look into them in detail hierarchical this type of dbms employs the parentchild relationship of storing data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of dbms is rarely used nowadays is structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields.The Windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes Network dbms.This type of dbms supports many to many relationships this usually results in complex database structures RDM server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of dbms defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations unlike the network dbms rdbms does not support many to many relationships relational dbms usually have predefined data types that they can support.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is the most popular dbms type in the market examples of relational database Management Systems include MySQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.Objectoriented relational dbms this type support storage of new data types the data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that Define what to do with the data postgresql is an example of objectoriented relational dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Off the spent huge amount of time in Researching on producing microsoft.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They started it right from Nineteen ninety six.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be talking about why dotnet and what is dotnet.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is a very interesting and very basic question, which people need to understand about microsoft.net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Paul we will understand why dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as sequel is actually the standard language were dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does not mean SQL cannot do things beyond that in fact it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like SQL oracle Ms SQL side etcetera use SQL sQl syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different and even proprietary SQL an example of an SQL statement selected star from members where age is greater than thirty DBMs stands for database management system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most wisely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It uses SQL as the standard query language sQL is the standard language used to query a database the database approach has many advantages when it comes to storing data compared to the traditional flat file based systems.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Sharp dot net C dot net and F. These are four microsoft provided dot net compliance languages by dot net compliance thailand that the languages which can target dot net framework work and can compile and execute on dot net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"With a vision that they provide support for common functionalities in Industry.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are so many Frameworks around which are providing infrastructure and support to build Enterprise applications.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is doing the similar thing what our normal framework does so a.net framework is also consisting of libraries and classes which are designed to achieve a common goal across various type of applications within Microsoft territory.Know if you want to understand a little bit more about framework than have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer, which is sitting between your operating system and Dot are compliant programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it is supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is a very interesting thing normally people understand that only C sharp or vb.net supports dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Whereas Visual Studio by default provides for programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are many other programming languages which are nonmicrosoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you want to know more about those programming languages, please go to the URL www dot dot net languages dot net and when you go to this website, you will see an image like this and this image shows all the supported languages, which can Target dotnet today.What is the purpose of this thing assume you have an application written in Kabul, which is a legacy application and you want to interact with a newly established system, which is running on dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how these two systems can communicate the COBOL code can be easily converted into Kabul dotnet and then these two programming languages or these two applications can talk to each other seamlessly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is API or also known as application programming interface.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, this is a very common term very useful term, but there is a problem with our society or our computer Society we give.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"FXnumberX whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Ill give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo selfpromotion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbojumbo with the API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Been looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments of comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with a JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and every one comment so that I can get the topic of the next video pretty simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well so that I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey, did everyone thinks you are back again with another video?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I do not really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"All I care about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I am not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going to put a satellite up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is some of the part is free for the Firebase and we will talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And that is it now sometime in that application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Heiner and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not talking about the PHP mask.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Heller and developer develops any product there are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some alternate uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\"}', 'url': 'https://lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2015-03-31/functions/mind-01daaqyn9gbebc92aywnxedp0c/invocations', 'context': {'client_region': 'us-east-1',

they share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now in this video we will talk about what is a pi or also known as application programming interface.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, this is a very common term very useful term.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But there is a problem with our society or our computer Society be give XnumberXfXnumberX, whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I will give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it is the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it is explain not where it not rain so as twenty start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going put a set up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i is now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Everyone they share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is a pi or also known as Catholic.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website legislate you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let us try to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who is selfpromotion?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now this sign of feature is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot a lot a lot of code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is tons of features on the Google Now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there is a problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key, so,.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So then the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docments integrated data store or IDS is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a lot while usage and expected functionalities of databases have been increased immensely types of dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In dot net Framework became public and it wont.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey there, everyone thinks you are back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the core MySQL.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That was somebody is running Windows Mac and Linux.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not an easy process to do.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you are running and in some of the special cases.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you do not have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some Alton is uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"See how the Dbms Family evolved with time the following diagram shows the evolution of DBMs categories.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Get into more details about dot net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help understand why dot net framework was necessarily needed what purpose it is whole in industry if you know about C or just programming languages or email very basic fundamental of these two programming running languages C users has include s or edge to perform the test and the kind functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Similarly C toss is a similar type of programming language with object to take framework in it and it uses on Io o dot these two languages are almost saying the from same type of functionality, but they have to different type of some time in what they have two different set of libraries altogether two and sometimes time management techniques and so on means if you have a type of application to be developed it can be new and feel or it can be developed using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with all interacting with new different from time environment and two send code windows.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming languages which require tradition code editors libraries and runtime.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, I assume you happen to have Visual Basic installed in your computer system and you have a third run time environment and the third code editor window and it goes on and on and on the more number of languages you pile up in your computer system.Now would not it be great if you just happen to have only one set of runtime one set of library and one single Editor to deal with programming languages.How Microsoft solved it let us have a look at that.So Inception and what is dotnet framework?.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was July XnumberX when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for nextgeneration Windows service, but Microsoft is marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Basics of Docker like in the comments section then I interested in and some the tutorials on the target that will get you quickly up and running with the topic yeah, I I a lot daughter there is no, I absolutely up the and one of the most important thing about this video in case you are near here hit that subscribe bton and I am gonna surely catch you in the next video to then get writing a anything code and join me one to bye bye this think and just take or has.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C, you know, it is a nightmare because C is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Starting a hello world in the grow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will share the link in the description below.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It says hello Crow and it is almost XnumberX months old but still works absolutely like a chance.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in case you are interested in that, I will post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Come to this tutorial series on SQL and database.But before we learn about database, let us understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In simple words data can be faxed related to any object and consideration.For example, your name age height weight Etc are some data related to you a picture image file PDF Etc can all be considered data now moved in one database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We already know what data is but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is a database management system dbms database management system or dbms is a collection of programs which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also helps control access to the database by various users.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management.System to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Your electricity service provider is obviously using a dbms to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data Etc.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisements and a lot more we can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of dbms.Database Management systems are not A New Concept and as such had been first implemented in the XnumberXs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is look into them in detail hierarchical this type of dbms employs the parentchild relationship of storing data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of dbms is rarely used nowadays is structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields.The Windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes Network dbms.This type of dbms supports many to many relationships this usually results in complex database structures RDM server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of dbms defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations unlike the network dbms rdbms does not support many to many relationships relational dbms usually have predefined data types that they can support.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is the most popular dbms type in the market examples of relational database Management Systems include MySQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.Objectoriented relational dbms this type support storage of new data types the data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that Define what to do with the data postgresql is an example of objectoriented relational dbms.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Off the spent huge amount of time in Researching on producing microsoft.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They started it right from Nineteen ninety six.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be talking about why dotnet and what is dotnet.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is a very interesting and very basic question, which people need to understand about microsoft.net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Paul we will understand why dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as sequel is actually the standard language were dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does not mean SQL cannot do things beyond that in fact it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like SQL oracle Ms SQL side etcetera use SQL sQl syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different and even proprietary SQL an example of an SQL statement selected star from members where age is greater than thirty DBMs stands for database management system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most wisely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It uses SQL as the standard query language sQL is the standard language used to query a database the database approach has many advantages when it comes to storing data compared to the traditional flat file based systems.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Sharp dot net C dot net and F. These are four microsoft provided dot net compliance languages by dot net compliance thailand that the languages which can target dot net framework work and can compile and execute on dot net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"With a vision that they provide support for common functionalities in Industry.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are so many Frameworks around which are providing infrastructure and support to build Enterprise applications.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is doing the similar thing what our normal framework does so a.net framework is also consisting of libraries and classes which are designed to achieve a common goal across various type of applications within Microsoft territory.Know if you want to understand a little bit more about framework than have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer, which is sitting between your operating system and Dot are compliant programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it is supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is a very interesting thing normally people understand that only C sharp or vb.net supports dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Whereas Visual Studio by default provides for programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are many other programming languages which are nonmicrosoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you want to know more about those programming languages, please go to the URL www dot dot net languages dot net and when you go to this website, you will see an image like this and this image shows all the supported languages, which can Target dotnet today.What is the purpose of this thing assume you have an application written in Kabul, which is a legacy application and you want to interact with a newly established system, which is running on dotnet framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how these two systems can communicate the COBOL code can be easily converted into Kabul dotnet and then these two programming languages or these two applications can talk to each other seamlessly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is API or also known as application programming interface.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, this is a very common term very useful term, but there is a problem with our society or our computer Society we give.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"FXnumberX whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Ill give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo selfpromotion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbojumbo with the API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Been looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments of comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with a JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and every one comment so that I can get the topic of the next video pretty simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well so that I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey, did everyone thinks you are back again with another video?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I do not really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"All I care about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I am not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going to put a satellite up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is some of the part is free for the Firebase and we will talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And that is it now sometime in that application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Heiner and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not talking about the PHP mask.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Heller and developer develops any product there are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some alternate uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\"}', 'url': 'https://lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2015-03-31/functions/mind-01daaqyn9gbebc92aywnxedp0c/invocations', 'context': {'client_region': 'us-east-1',

So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is. \"], \"2019-09-28T05:35:19Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"a0349078dbc746199b273b5a3b3e8f51\"], \"segment2\": [[\"Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.

But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me. Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who's self-promotion? So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up. Now this sign of feature is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website. It writes a lot a lot a lot of code. We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I. \"], \"2019-09-28T05:37:19Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"05418ea0e60849dfa66c921df680dd04\"], \"segment3\": [[\"Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There's tons of features on the Google Now. We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written. I'm just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there's a problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key, so,. \"], \"2019-09-28T05:39:19Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"e162b8e46e5043fcbc0401c62946099b\"], \"segment4\": [[\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.

I'm not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it's explain not where it not rain so as twenty start.

What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important. So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well. Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now. Also, I would request everybody to suggest me. What should I make next on this channel? I'll be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the.

I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I'll try I'll try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook. The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well. But yes, I'll try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up. In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions. So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well.

Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program.

So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:50:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"c95cfbd65bb74021a68a32498ef2be13\"]}, \"2\": {\"segment0\": [[\"There are many other programming languages which are non-microsoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are.

So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting. So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video. Now in this video. We will talk about what is API or also known as application programming interface.

We just want it to be technically correct. So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API. What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature. You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:07:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"14ba6e2668c146fa8f294f8c6857e4c5\"], \"segment2\": [[\"Choose your favorite Indigo Airlines. But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:09:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"5eecf955a9b0410ea727ca9b6f202f21\"], \"segment3\": [[\"It sure is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:11:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"2943de8a83ac41459ba342f4c113efd3\"], \"segment4\": [[\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on. What is API rather?. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:13:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"964ccb25b2254e65b6158a2586e4d4c8\"], \"segment5\": [[\"Been looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.

It was July 2000 when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for next-generation Windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:01:36Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"adc56d11b0db4c81b3c06366bddba7a8\"], \"segment7\": [[\"What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?.

So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system. It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it's supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications. So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C++ dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries. So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports.

We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now.

The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:09:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"5eecf955a9b0410ea727ca9b6f202f21\"], \"segment12\": [[\"It sure is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:11:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"2943de8a83ac41459ba342f4c113efd3\"], \"segment13\": [[\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.

I'm not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it's explain not where it not rain so as twenty start. I'm not going put a set up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i's now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is the.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:41:19Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"f39b07dcecb2486ab257e6f14cd769ac\"], \"segment5\": [[\"Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.

Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:48:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"8230ba7ceaa74bdd9f16580ff591269a\"], \"segment9\": [[\"I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you. Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:50:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"c95cfbd65bb74021a68a32498ef2be13\"]}, \"2\": {\"segment0\": [[\"There are many other programming languages which are non-microsoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are.

What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature. You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:07:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"14ba6e2668c146fa8f294f8c6857e4c5\"], \"segment2\": [[\"Choose your favorite Indigo Airlines. But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:09:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"5eecf955a9b0410ea727ca9b6f202f21\"], \"segment3\": [[\"It sure is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:11:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"2943de8a83ac41459ba342f4c113efd3\"], \"segment4\": [[\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.

It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:48:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"8230ba7ceaa74bdd9f16580ff591269a\"], \"segment3\": [[\"I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.

So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance.

It was July 2000 when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for next-generation Windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:01:36Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"adc56d11b0db4c81b3c06366bddba7a8\"], \"segment7\": [[\"What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?.

So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system. It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it's supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications. So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C++ dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries. So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports.

We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now.

The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:09:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"5eecf955a9b0410ea727ca9b6f202f21\"], \"segment12\": [[\"It sure is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:11:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"2943de8a83ac41459ba342f4c113efd3\"], \"segment13\": [[\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.

So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written. I'm just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there's a problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key, so,. \"], \"2019-09-28T05:39:19Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"e162b8e46e5043fcbc0401c62946099b\"], \"segment4\": [[\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.

This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it's the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start. I'm not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it's explain not where it not rain so as twenty start. I'm not going put a set up there.

So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API.

Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:48:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"8230ba7ceaa74bdd9f16580ff591269a\"], \"segment9\": [[\"I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you. Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:50:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"c95cfbd65bb74021a68a32498ef2be13\"]}, \"2\": {\"segment0\": [[\"There are many other programming languages which are non-microsoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are.

Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.

What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature.

The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:09:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"5eecf955a9b0410ea727ca9b6f202f21\"], \"segment3\": [[\"It sure is login system.

There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it.

Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well.

So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:46:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"1e735599a49d466989823efd580a574e\"], \"segment2\": [[\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code. And these are absolutely portable. The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:48:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"8230ba7ceaa74bdd9f16580ff591269a\"], \"segment3\": [[\"I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.

So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance.

It was July 2000 when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for next-generation Windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later on named it as dotnet.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:01:36Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"adc56d11b0db4c81b3c06366bddba7a8\"], \"segment7\": [[\"What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?.

So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system. It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it's supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications. So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C++ dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries. So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports.

We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now.

The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code. \"], \"2019-09-28T06:09:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"5eecf955a9b0410ea727ca9b6f202f21\"], \"segment12\": [[\"It sure is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex.\"], \"2019-09-28T06:11:27Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"2943de8a83ac41459ba342f4c113efd3\"], \"segment13\": [[\"Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.

What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is.  \n",

      "Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website legislate you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines. But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me. Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who's self-promotion? So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up. Now this sign of feature is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website. It writes a lot a lot a lot of code. We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I.  \n",

      "Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There's tons of features on the Google Now. We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written. I'm just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there's a problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key, so,.  \n",

      "If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords. So yes that is it. This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it's the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start. I'm not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it's explain not where it not rain so as twenty start. I'm not going put a set up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i's now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is the. \n",

      "Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it. Now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well. So then the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on. What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important. So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well. Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now. Also, I would request everybody to suggest me. What should I make next on this channel? I'll be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the. Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing. If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards. I'll try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there. I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I'll try I'll try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook. The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well. But yes, I'll try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up. In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions. So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well. So.  \n",

We're going to talk about Docker after watching this video. I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience. The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me. So let's get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow. I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem. So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand. What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.  \n",

      "We're at developer develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs. Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight. \n",

      "They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code. And these are absolutely portable. The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform. \n",

      "I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you. Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy. \n",

      "There are many other programming languages which are non-microsoft means Microsoft Corporation did not produce those languages but Microsoft service supported those programming language has to be converted into dotnet compliant what those languages are. If you want to know more about those programming languages, please go to the URL www dot dot net languages dot net and when you go to this website, you will see an image like this and this image shows all the supported languages, which can Target dotnet today.What is the purpose of this thing assume you have an application written in Kabul, which is a legacy application and you want to interact with a newly established system, which is running on dotnet framework. So how these two systems can communicate the COBOL code can be easily converted into Kabul dotnet and then these two programming languages or these two applications can talk to each other seamlessly. So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting. So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video. Now in this video.

      "F2 whether people understand that subject or not. We just want it to be technically correct. So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API. What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.I'll give you two examples.

The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common.

There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature.

      "Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.

The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging.

      "I can give you exact timing when I would be live. And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey there, everyone thinks you're back again with another video. And in this video. We're going to talk about Docker after watching this video. I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience. The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me. So let's get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow. I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem. So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand. What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.  \n",

      "We're at developer develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs. Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight. \n",

Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform. \n",

      "I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you. Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy. \n",

In simple words data can be faxed related to any object and consideration.For example, your name age height weight Etc are some data related to you a picture image file PDF Etc can all be considered data now moved in one database. We already know what data is but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized. It makes data management easy. What is a database management system dbms database management system or dbms is a collection of programs which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management.System to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details. Your electricity service provider is obviously using a dbms to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data Etc. Let's consider the Facebook. It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisements and a lot more we can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of dbms.Database Management systems are not A New Concept and as such had been first implemented in the 1960s. \n",

So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages. Now, I assume you happen to have Visual Basic installed in your computer system and you have a third run time environment and the third code editor window and it goes on and on and on the more number of languages you pile up in your computer system.Now wouldn't it be great if you just happen to have only one set of runtime one set of library and one single Editor to deal with programming languages.How Microsoft solved it let's have a look at that.So Inception and what is dotnet framework?. It was July 2000 when Bill Gates appeared in a PDC which stands for professional developer conference in Orlando, Florida where he revealed that we have a product now and we call it microsoft.net framework.Microsoft.net originally was named as an gws which stands for next-generation Windows service, but Microsoft's marketing team later on named it as dotnet. \n",

      "What is not a New Concept in Industry usually Frameworks are designed?. With a vision that they provide support for common functionalities in Industry. There are so many Frameworks around which are providing infrastructure and support to build Enterprise applications. Now what microsoft.net framework does though? It is doing the similar thing what our normal framework does so a.net framework is also consisting of libraries and classes which are designed to achieve a common goal across various type of applications within Microsoft territory.Know if you want to understand a little bit more about framework than have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer, which is sitting between your operating system and Dot are compliant programming languages. So microsoft.net framework is a software layer which sits between your visual studio and operating system. It supports many programming languages as a framework is supposed to do it's supposed to provide common functionality across different type of applications. So microsoft.net framework is a common layer for all the microsoft.net programming languages like C sharp vb.net C++ dotnet and even F sharp.Dotnet provides common set of class libraries. So if you have a system namespace in microsoft.net framework, then that is accessible by all the programming languages dotnet framework what languages taught that supports. This is a very interesting thing normally people understand that only C sharp or vb.net supports dotnet framework. Whereas Visual Studio by default provides for programming languages. \n",

So how these two systems can communicate the COBOL code can be easily converted into Kabul dotnet and then these two programming languages or these two applications can talk to each other seamlessly. So that is the beauty what microsoft.net was providing supporting. So hope you learned about what is dotnet and why dotnet thank you very much for watching the video.They share back again with another video. Now in this video.

      "F2 whether people understand that subject or not. We just want it to be technically correct. So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand an API. What is API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or block because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the feature or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple. Now EPA is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various website legislature. You want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and.  \n",

      "Choose your favorite Indigo Airlines. But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say woohoo self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.About this sign of future is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of my way of handling the sign up pretty common. Nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website, it writes a lot lot and lot of food, we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up. There are tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.so one of their code.  \n",

      "It sure is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up with the Google with one click you can just use that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I don't have to worry about what they have written how they have written and just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google? This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air with tickets or. You have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log into the Facebook. Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free. There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well. So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say, hey the problem at all. I'll give you a unique API key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track even can shut down you so this is your very very basic example of how the API key works. So yes that is it. This is it this is your API now there is no such extreme mumbo-jumbo with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yet the definition has made it so complex. \n",

      "Now onto a summary node, I would say that. Yes API is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why it is being returned or what the circumstances would have been that why this people have written this code. All I care about is this is someone's else code that he's legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example logging in with the Google or logging it with the Facebook are the most common example of using the API of Facebook and Google and you might have seen other things as well. Like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of weather application under Tony Stark, I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we where will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark? I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already.I can use their apis. Now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use. But if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a library loading database. That's some of the part is free for the Firebase and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance cost some time is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about how that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood. What is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on. What is API rather?.  \n",

This type of dbms is rarely used nowadays is structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields.The Windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes Network dbms.This type of dbms supports many to many relationships this usually results in complex database structures RDM server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational dbms. This type of dbms defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations unlike the network dbms rdbms does not support many to many relationships relational dbms usually have predefined data types that they can support. This is the most popular dbms type in the market examples of relational database Management Systems include MySQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server.Object-oriented relational dbms this type support storage of new data types the data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that Define what to do with the data postgresql is an example of object-oriented relational dbms.

It uses SQL as the standard query language sQL is the standard language used to query a database the database approach has many advantages when it comes to storing data compared to the traditional flat file based systems. \n",

back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We will talk about what is a pi or also known as Catholic.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Indeed everyone they share back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now in this video we will talk about what is a pi or also known as application programming interface.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, this is a very common term very useful term.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But there is a problem with our society or our computer Society be give XnumberXfXnumberX, whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I will give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website legislate you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jaipur to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let us try to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who is selfpromotion?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now this sign of feature is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot a lot a lot of code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is tons of features on the Google Now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there is a problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key, so,.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it is the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it is explain not where it not rain so as twenty start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going put a set up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i is now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So then the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey there, everyone thinks you are back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some Alton is uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the core MySQL.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That was somebody is running Windows Mac and Linux.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not an easy process to do.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you are running and in some of the special cases.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you do not have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C, you know, it is a nightmare because C is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Starting a hello world in the grow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will share the link in the description below.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It says hello Crow and it is almost XnumberX months old but still works absolutely like a chance.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in case you are interested in that, I will post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\"}', 'url':

Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let us try to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who is selfpromotion?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We use a kind of a feature known as sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now this sign of feature is pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let us bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot a lot a lot of code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for but I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for login sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is tons of features on the Google Now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is signin feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of their code feature is login system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And if you notice that on our website, which is learned toward online dot in we use a feature known as sign up vertically with one click you can just use that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the codes written by Google which is login in this case and try to incorporate that in my website now, although this entire code is written by the Google but I do not have to worry about what they have written how they have written.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing up a few of my variable and using the features of the Google that they have provided for me and how I actually am I able to do so, how am I able to provide you features of logging it with the Google?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is all through why API and yes with the help of API you can do all such features like booking a for the air.The tickets are things you have already seen like one of them is log in with Google or log in with the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, there is one also key important aspect if everybody will be able to use these kinds of apis for free.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are high chances that it can get simply overused or some people may use it for some nonsense purposes as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced also known as API key Now API key is again a method by which I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the Google that hey I want to use your login feature and Google will say hey, there is a problem at all.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will give you a unique API key, so,.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you make an announcement activity I can track even and can chat down you so this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is that this is your a P I now there no such extreme mumbo over with the API it is the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the definition has made it so complex here now on a summary note I would say that he has API is just code written by someone else that I dont really bother how it is being written why it is being written or what the would have been that why these people have it in this code all I can about is this is someone is else code that he is legally giving me permission to use that code and I can use that in my application for example, logging in Google or logging it with the face with our the most common example of using the API of Facebook Google and you might have seen other things as well like for example, if I want to just use or make a simple mobile app of whether application and not Tony any start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any set into the space and that is going to calculate with a whole complex things and going on there and we will give me the data where we where will it is explain not where it not rain so as twenty start.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not going put a set up there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use that a p i is now some of the a p s are three and some of them are not like sign up in Google in the here that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database as we call as a live learning database that some of the priorities is free for the file and we start about the highways and some other movies and when if the user database is growing you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance cost sometime is there little bit but on to let us forget about how that thing and focus again on API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now you understand that API is the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Written by someone else and you can use that code in your application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You have to use an API key as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So then the misuse of that code or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me know in the comments comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use API with the JavaScript or PHP or maybe Swift or baby Java what you would like to see up next now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Also, I would request everybody to suggest me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What should I make next on this channel?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will be looking up on the comment section of each and everyone come and so that I can get the.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Think of the next video pretty simple as it sounds now one more thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you have missed that out in the last video now, I have decided that from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will try to make sure that on every Sunday we go live and I talked to you guys live out there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I have realized that a lot of people love this that when I go live, so I have decided that whenever I will try I will try to make sure that I go live on every Sunday now follow up my page on the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yes, I will try to make sure that you get the timing and most people can join up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So with this notify me in the comment section that how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I can give you exact timing when I would be live.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And with this I will surely catch you up in the next video.Hey there, everyone thinks you are back again with another video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Were going to talk about Docker after watching this video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The personal one where Docker was absolutely Lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let us get started and talk about what is Docker whenever a product is being designed the first and the only goal with that product is I want to solve a specific problem or somehow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I want to reduce the friction that users are currently facing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the docker first and foremost, we need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody is else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Even when that project is moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are definitely some Alton is uncertainties that occurs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it does not work like that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it is compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it is going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the core MySQL.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That was somebody is running Windows Mac and Linux.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not an easy process to do.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you are running and in some of the special cases.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you do not have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C, you know, it is a nightmare because C is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Starting a hello world in the grow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will share the link in the description below.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It says hello Crow and it is almost XnumberX months old but still works absolutely like a chance.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in case you are interested in that, I will post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\"}', 'url':

useful term.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But there is a problem with our society or our computer Society be give XnumberXfXnumberX, whether people understand that subject or not.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We just want it to be technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That is one part when they are not so much understandable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let us get started.Let is talk about what is a pi now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbojumbo.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here is the problem the people who are already using the API do not need to understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is API because they know about it, but the people who do not understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I will give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity, you do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But that API is actually helping now.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you book it from a various website

now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who is selfpromotion?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us just carry on and forward that you might have seen

\\\\\\\\\\\"Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you are running and in some of the special cases.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you do not have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C, you know, it is a nightmare because C is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Starting a hello world in the grow.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I will share the link in the description below.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It says hello Crow and it is almost XnumberX months old but still works absolutely like a chance.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in case you are interested in that, I will post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\\\\\\\\\\\"]}\\\"}', 'url':

There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs. Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:46:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"1e735599a49d466989823efd580a574e\"], \"segment7\": [[\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code. And these are absolutely portable. The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases.

So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:48:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"8230ba7ceaa74bdd9f16580ff591269a\"], \"segment8\": [[\"I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you. Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:50:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"c95cfbd65bb74021a68a32498ef2be13\"]}}, \"ts\": \"2019-09-30T15:17:35.036755Z\", \"msg\": \"Final PIMs\"}\n"

There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs. Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:46:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"1e735599a49d466989823efd580a574e\"], \"segment7\": [[\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code.

Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases.

Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:50:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"c95cfbd65bb74021a68a32498ef2be13\"]}}, \"ts\": \"2019-09-30T15:17:35.037911Z\", \"msg\": \"Final PIMs\"}\n"

There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs. Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:46:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"1e735599a49d466989823efd580a574e\"], \"segment7\": [[\"They know and these containers are the absolute heart of the docker these container wrap up your entire code. And these are absolutely portable. The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code.

So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy.\"], \"2019-09-28T05:50:17Z\", \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"c95cfbd65bb74021a68a32498ef2be13\"]}}, \"ts\": \"2019-09-30T15:17:35.039017Z\", \"msg\": \"Final PIMs\"}\n"

Now, this is a very common term very useful term. But there is a problem with our society or our computer Society be give 0f2, whether people understand that subject or not. We just want it to be technically correct. So if you look up for the API definition on any platform Wikipedia blog, they are technically correct. That's one part when they are not so much understandable. So in this video we are going to make sure that you understand and API what else API and after watching this video you never ever watch any video on API or blog because you will be understanding each and every bit of API, so let's get started.Let's talk about what is a pi now. Go ahead open up your favorite search engine and try to look up for what is API? Let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Wikipedia here API. What is it a set of function and procedure that allows to create of application which acts as the Beecher or data of an operating system application or other services again, a mumbo-jumbo. That means we don't get it. What is a pi now. The problem is this definition is perfectly correct. And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand. What is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API, we need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example.Well, then I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation board very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now EPA is.  \n",

But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go Ivy were.com or any other such services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is a pi now before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it. Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me. Up my own website here, which is learn code online dot game now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say well who's self-promotion? So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up. Now this sign of feature is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I send you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much serious to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website.

      "We're at developer develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time occurs. Well that problem is whenever you're designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer, maybe your friends or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django python JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Alton's uncertainties that occurs. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly met.The father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight. \n",

The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now, you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on your machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you are learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP maskull package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL. It's one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and config will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform. \n",

      "I'm just like you share anything you can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint, you can start there and last but not the least Docker is also a company that does and manage all of this for you. Now as I promised in the start of the video, I will share some of the personal experience with the docker as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we have to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the libraries now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but a ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the bring work that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the grow. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I start the student that how the initial basics of the docker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the crow for the first time. It just saved me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably a little while ago. It says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about Docker and rainy. \n",

Dont how any with having but engine General communities. Yeah, it is was giving good results. I just few meetings so in that I also observe that we are able to say generated good groups are coming up and the general call the development. The segments go with instances as code low so by was paying outfit with as a sentence level and I group the scale of four changes but generally does not behavior. Brand able to distinguish domain out of the and that case. See you shared one meeting and which I think why not groups that. So in that I saw that the bad group called load. Think one you showed like this case, it is not enough for us simple to know we have to have some there to actually remove the. Checking of that, but it not thing to do but what I of is but that my showing will be on on the model in this model in this case I saw that is with below point seven while back. We have to do yeah so do you have any audio call the reference meetings on which can check call you that is already shared and he is doing it. Waiting from normal podcasts to sinks and then normal sentencing these kind of things. Yeah that is a good Validation right at least from the ID perspective. And those meeting you will not find generate groups. There are very few meeting will will you will find you define generated groups to week but we entered that we already but most in in in in a. And model out of the domains would usually go down and that is that is fine should we even worry about the. So one one thing which I was trying to say is like if you have only five to six groups and you do not have any current score implementation. So we are trying to score these groups with mine then the out of domain are irrelevant one is would like if you have only three groups put come down but we need to have some way to remove them and throw only what what. Let is do this okay let us not worry about removing out of domain segment for now let us let us try to be able to. Let is let us be every ram for properly right as. Rank is I think it is related you that get the brand, but what she expecting it. It is that we have to see what we and i. But that anyway, we we we have not it really given a serious part to that never tried. So we have always let on rank. So but now let us figure correct. Let let it go to do you have any other concerns right i know earlier we used to have lot of segments rank so the library back one. I that slow but now you number of you know ram then it this would be low that means the communities right i know that is bad but but unless I think we should think of if if you guys have any attempt to refresh that is fine, but the but officially severely may heavily really depends on the model and independent payment. I am not exactly sure whether it would be bad to show that but more it is good to have the control of one is good and. I agree i mean I have there is no denying right?.  Yeah, well all I trying to say is is yes if you are able to rank it. Let is move to less mobile production and then and then right and then obviously it is stability quality that immediately. We can call on to taking more control on what is good as a somebody. Should we put some number of groups, which we sent back. Yeah, you just send everything get them. Okay But still do the user do we show everything with thing. That is okay again, let us not worry about it. What if it is only a python now. Because I was playing around with the groups and. Wanted to have like only two or three unlimited to four or five you instead of going one level that we can go and then try to show it. So so there is no question of having that production right right. May be like one or two days and the. Okay But but I think if you plan do not you think in the current we cannot move into production and then and then we show like maybe five most likely if I do would cover almost all of the meeting. So even if it is in demos or even if it is in the same calls. So we need not worry about that. Yeah so so these things we can figure out all on like on the call like we might get some ideas. So so that is not worry about one you know the if it is not necessarily I not worry about what is go going into the things not on second thing the number of things. Let it as is let us not change it only thing is we just move existing communities to production which means that will send back everything i mean the response from the community s p lambda be all the second and then they index okay. Okay So let us let us take to that another what about training the other minds and so and my so come to minds first. So do you think they should we should increase number of right away or your then. Oh we get we can increase the number sentences the problem is how to adjust those generate sentences if because we we are not able we we tried latest code between the cluster. We are not able to aggregate the generates sentences so. Like as in one once and one oneplus will be like if you read it standalone alone you will not be able to say that it is software engineering related adults. So it will give goods scope to even if you get a gave up product product up but. But we thought where they manually remove it right that uploaded the mind in our we can manually remove do not worry remove that. That we can do what I was thinking whether it. It should be whether there should be some technique to automate automatic one. When then we go to slack based said it is I do not think we should we look at as a testing if he given that we do not have this to the data then we do not get to see yeah, so we and and most likely whatever comes as communities as we improve the way we found the mine sent is our mind reference we with mute. So let us not worry about improving in the current state or now we can remote manually from all the minds. Then we can increase the number of cluster centers because. If you have a test alytics to turn if you have tested. If if that is generating because we. Just see whether those are relevant if I read them individually my. Fifteen and see if there is an and gain on the current state and it not just leaving we. So who is done try on on the rest of the model minds. Right not our Janice is validating on ether in g okay. So offering engineering will be deployed first into production. Once these two are once we have that but done with this. Then we will stick those dropping summer and do that really. That is fine so and then on the other today you have everything you need for production platform. Just been now okay it we got. Yeah, I mean yeah, I was to it is, but the is us to go to staging right. The grouping segment Service and Andre that in both staging and production. There are a few changes which API I need to take for bringing this community developments. So of finish everything from my my side. I think I have done almost everything yeah week few things and it should be okay. Isnt while we use minds for it is good right?.  So the way the the way we the flow goes is it finalized. The of feature on feature for each group and then comparing to mind and do to take to rank South feature of groups. Taking a taking a single feature vector for group and at a sentence level the scale of change, but generally the order of order of renting skip. Okay So okay then fine so if the final error so we stick to sentence in. We we will take to sentences okay. So then then maybe we should do one thing I am not sure but who but with the existing with the current call. So there is no good or bad. It is only about sharing know only good. So what we can do is for all that testing thing calls that we had seized using we have to run it through current we have to run it through payments based teams current approach is possible have not current model with communities which is brought if come communities. It is so you should already have this right. Yeah, I already have we can run it done and it is not to be. And then I am done with the with the and if you share it. We can whoever is learning can share it and then we can you know we can all have and and see what whatever you do in our skills so that validation. And one more thing is like for the current terms first I would still i cannot use the Google list will have deep from transcript and theyve. Yeah, that is fine because we do there comparison with on investor. They have the same way so that. So who can do that who like half through that I sit you were at given we are just then. But I think they do not have proper but maybe are. Okay Then yeah so all you need to do is you need to run to in the. Yes, and then take the final group and systems. Any specification number of meeting this you want me to run. It is not my there no barrier intervention. It can run it all the test meetings that you have which are like also so like yeah yeah that is it. Okay So then we we stick to that moving the community database and then also texting the minds right and my time I actually looking at a subject direct identification from the from the segment or even from the from the paragraph and then I then I had I have spent some time on on the same. I spent some time on named entty, which which I wanted it for action detection to so first and then to to asociate objective with the verb in the process actually I have I think if I was telling you this both the week our last right named entties wherein. I have found unable in the graph with only the proper using and model entty recognition. I may to found the good graph and then and then out of curious they just tried extending that tool ether you know, slack channel engineering channel. So what happened was even if even if a call even if the name entty properly identify is not present in the software engineering it is able to it is able to find the close name entties with certain conference. So that means if if I put it the a now you know point five on on the distance so anything about that is actually getting usually what what that new name take my trigger to so this could be called this could be like a festival opportunity which get out any high, but if I know it could be whatever what session is working on he he is also looking into the same thing so once once he available can we can just understand something. I think this can be used without doing any literal string match that means even if you have you know, some all it needs is the context of three or four sentences in which the name where it is used if the context is found in slack most likely you might find a reference to the closest match to that within the software engineering mind, even if it is, you know DeLorean it is actually I have seen some, you know video audio based entities coming as the most similar ones.So I am just I am dead. This would I would use this for both audio collection item matching the subject to the work Associated and also possibly for what do you call the key phrase filtration early phase filtration though, but but performing the the computer to have that I was I was referring to some couple of weeks back. I think this sounded more stable than populating all the key phrases now. We need to figure out a way to. Entities to the non named entity key phrases if at all that competition is possible. I will share I will share some at least if he root by to day after possibly this week has been I will spend as significant time on this one to to see where it takes us. I think the Janice of everything again, it is Janice n yeah. I think that is it from my side. Okay So sure okay so you can update whenever saw okay yeah. With any are we were planning to have a bug model for any. Okay Youre planning to have using the box model. Just take the data for any training which is available and then convert to case and to work for. That is reasonable, but I am just trying to but start because I is very nicely. So so if we by some pre processing that they pay some you know for spending some time on the data be that would be more stable data tests and this that is that is very much possible because even I as I as I posted to this morning even the bird model case sensitive. But that is because of data is to drink that I had. Because because the Validation data or in the writing data I was imagine also this morning the valuation is itself happen on that kind of data so they they get ninety ninety back. So we need to what try to do is take the same bit of it. So trying to you know try to deny it and and and see if we can stabilize it and then use the data for so I think done first I am recognition. Which data is could be same the oil yeah. So if if the first works for every mind what I can do is I can even take or maybe if I am not on what thinking right dont open here it has load get it on the user is it yes yeah, we can do that. I am not sure because right right now least to prove whatever what we call to prove whether it will help us to form and also the topics topic are arrived least if we comments get within this week I think we should we can take the task of trying that models. Probably we have to we are done with with this deployment one of one can take it. But should not make any difference right like it does not matter the domain. Instance is only based on similarity instance is based on the similarity the ping just taking it out. I think out what is the more more similar in other notes if if I if I do a if I do a participant. Like high level that means I do not I do not look at the most similar one if I look at the top drop one right okay. The fairways actually see if you are if you are talking about compute graph. We do pairwise similarity, but we do not form wedges between everything. Not I do not think we can do that how that we need to figure out a different but that but we have to learn minute is. No way I am talking about even if you have to do pairwise that is only to invest the graph of. The online representations the real thing we have to do at the community level hierarchy has to be well if if whatever what you are trying to do is if it is so independent of the timeline we should be able to use use that place out there. Yeah, let me just see if we can discuss gonna to show you something. So yeah this is what it is. Guarantee from from the same and then under the hero. The features is actually like taking I think all the symptoms that we missed about Microsoft okay, then and then after code. I will ready go there feature this to found different the word microsoft. So yeah, that is what it just works but we see how good it integrates with the how how good we can actually extend this to a slack data right monitor testing on on a relatively model and I was kind of okay I just need to tested this this this the one just your thing currently. But when you are taking the feature letter for the Node one that is the direct feature vector of the key or know. It restart exactly that is actually the that is wherever is there has correct. It has been like Nineteen articles okay maybe within actively and what but it has like maybe it has like four or five entries for. During instance, you take the mean of everywhere as you in the segment or something. Within meeting me I think we can even compare it with the sentence in which it if yeah single. Under the main comparison you are doing we on those feature that is also so that you not do not make any image much. I need to figure out a way to compare this to the key actually we just because like it. Maybe I think for some would be parallel working of it. So that he is is on what I thought we can we can just do separately and then because that testing been accelerating I and then we will see what go comes up. I think if you want you can I think I will.Make a copy of this and then share it you can you can check this and let me know what you think. Yeah when you had asked me to do a comparison between models as they were training how they performed on ether sync. So it turns out that training is actually very helpful. If you take pretty out of the box like the pins are really bad even the calls are horrible with I mind S c my dot and if we take the S e model it becomes better but performed greatly on ether Thursday calls and if we take ether and ether heard it performed service. That seems really obvious but but to know that traffic. I I think that is good because so yeah watch watch that is the model based ether mind even one about forms that has well. You can do one first conversion between whatever was whatever like what what three was test right like like he the was a and then you can do the same on ether calls with we call share the results on ether things with the I mentioned a model based mind and ether the ether model based. Yeah if that is what it knows then you can can just share it maybe you can it and. When I doing all comparison right this G kind of around testing calls I mind specific for that particular domain which the call was started. We can just what our mind that is to be to stay till just just pick pick the mind pick for for anything. Okay, but I call this in which you think are relevant relevant to the ether testing call or whatever sprint and called L is got. Because I do not have ether engineering model in GB whereas and word i have that and. Before I used to do with just the yeah like this bird and with. I think now you can use this ether engineering mind if one of them is convinced that we can go ahead our okay sure yeah. The last thing is I did the Vector conversation of the teams approach and it is actually provided lot of speed. So for video hundred thousand feature vectors us the old takes six seconds where the new approach takes about three hundred fifty minutes seconds. So if a order we have will to sentence comparisons that should have yeah. Okay So this add that to any any new deployment right sure add to the maybe it can you could just share that with three so that we can add whatever expect. With the GDP deployment rights keep more deployments should be like make everything aspects right now. Like the current one one is not. We can make it fix yeah we do not have problem with there no no, we did not see any that is all we did not finish with it. These things are not yet in the report it least in the master right. In the staging topic we can replace okay yeah. Yeah, we can and then and then we can use it yeah.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"nsp\\\\\\\\\\\": false}\\\"}', 'url': 'https://lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2015-03-31/functions/mind-01dadp74wfv607knpcb6vvxgtg/invocations', 'context': {'client_region': 'us-east-1', 'client_config': <botocore.config.Config object at 0x7f97bfabec10>, 'has_streaming_input': True, 'auth_type': None}}\"}\n"

I that slow but now you number of you know ram then it this would be low that means the communities right i know that is bad but but unless I think we should think of if if you guys have any attempt to refresh that is fine, but the but officially severely may heavily really depends on the model and independent payment. I am not exactly sure whether it would be bad to show that but more it is good to have the control of one is good and. I agree i mean I have there is no denying right?.  Yeah, well all I trying to say is is yes if you are able to rank it. Let is move to less mobile production and then and then right and then obviously it is stability quality that immediately. We can call on to taking more control on what is good as a somebody. Should we put some number of groups, which we sent back. Yeah, you just send everything get them. Okay But still do the user do we show everything with thing. That is okay again, let us not worry about it. What if it is only a python now. Because I was playing around with the groups and. Wanted to have like only two or three unlimited to four or five you instead of going one level that we can go and then try to show it. So so there is no question of having that production right right. May be like one or two days and the. Okay But but I think if you plan do not you think in the current we cannot move into production and then and then we show like maybe five most likely if I do would cover almost all of the meeting. So even if it is in demos or even if it is in the same calls. So we need not worry about that. Yeah so so these things we can figure out all on like on the call like we might get some ideas. So so that is not worry about one you know the if it is not necessarily I not worry about what is go going into the things not on second thing the number of things. Let it as is let us not change it only thing is we just move existing communities to production which means that will send back everything i mean the response from the community s p lambda be all the second and then they index okay. Okay So let us let us take to that another what about training the other minds and so and my so come to minds first. So do you think they should we should increase number of right away or your then. Oh we get we can increase the number sentences the problem is how to adjust those generate sentences if because we we are not able we we tried latest code between the cluster. We are not able to aggregate the generates sentences so. Like as in one once and one oneplus will be like if you read it standalone alone you will not be able to say that it is software engineering related adults. So it will give goods scope to even if you get a gave up product product up but. But we thought where they manually remove it right that uploaded the mind in our we can manually remove do not worry remove that. That we can do what I was thinking whether it. It should be whether there should be some technique to automate automatic one. When then we go to slack based said it is I do not think we should we look at as a testing if he given that we do not have this to the data then we do not get to see yeah, so we and and most likely whatever comes as communities as we improve the way we found the mine sent is our mind reference we with mute. So let us not worry about improving in the current state or now we can remote manually from all the minds. Then we can increase the number of cluster centers because. If you have a test alytics to turn if you have tested. If if that is generating because we. Just see whether those are relevant if I read them individually my. Fifteen and see if there is an and gain on the current state and it not just leaving we. So who is done try on on the rest of the model minds. Right not our Janice is validating on ether in g okay. So offering engineering will be deployed first into production. Once these two are once we have that but done with this. Then we will stick those dropping summer and do that really. That is fine so and then on the other today you have everything you need for production platform. Just been now okay it we got. Yeah, I mean yeah, I was to it is, but the is us to go to staging right. The grouping segment Service and Andre that in both staging and production. There are a few changes which API I need to take for bringing this community developments. So of finish everything from my my side. I think I have done almost everything yeah week few things and it should be okay. Isnt while we use minds for it is good right?.  So the way the the way we the flow goes is it finalized. The of feature on feature for each group and then comparing to mind and do to take to rank South feature of groups. Taking a taking a single feature vector for group and at a sentence level the scale of change, but generally the order of order of renting skip. Okay So okay then fine so if the final error so we stick to sentence in. We we will take to sentences okay. So then then maybe we should do one thing I am not sure but who but with the existing with the current call. So there is no good or bad. It is only about sharing know only good. So what we can do is for all that testing thing calls that we had seized using we have to run it through current we have to run it through payments based teams current approach is possible have not current model with communities which is brought if come communities. It is so you should already have this right. Yeah, I already have we can run it done and it is not to be. And then I am done with the with the and if you share it. We can whoever is learning can share it and then we can you know we can all have and and see what whatever you do in our skills so that validation. And one more thing is like for the current terms first I would still i cannot use the Google list will have deep from transcript and theyve. Yeah, that is fine because we do there comparison with on investor. They have the same way so that. So who can do that who like half through that I sit you were at given we are just then. But I think they do not have proper but maybe are. Okay Then yeah so all you need to do is you need to run to in the. Yes, and then take the final group and systems. Any specification number of meeting this you want me to run. It is not my there no barrier intervention. It can run it all the test meetings that you have which are like also so like yeah yeah that is it. Okay So then we we stick to that moving the community database and then also texting the minds right and my time I actually looking at a subject direct identification from the from the segment or even from the from the paragraph and then I then I had I have spent some time on on the same. I spent some time on named entty, which which I wanted it for action detection to so first and then to to asociate objective with the verb in the process actually I have I think if I was telling you this both the week our last right named entties wherein. I have found unable in the graph with only the proper using and model entty recognition. I may to found the good graph and then and then out of curious they just tried extending that tool ether you know, slack channel engineering channel. So what happened was even if even if a call even if the name entty properly identify is not present in the software engineering it is able to it is able to find the close name entties with certain conference. So that means if if I put it the a now you know point five on on the distance so anything about that is actually getting usually what what that new name take my trigger to so this could be called this could be like a festival opportunity which get out any high, but if I know it could be whatever what session is working on he he is also looking into the same thing so once once he available can we can just understand something. I think this can be used without doing any literal string match that means even if you have you know, some all it needs is the context of three or four sentences in which the name where it is used if the context is found in slack most likely you might find a reference to the closest match to that within the software engineering mind, even if it is, you know DeLorean it is actually I have seen some, you know video audio based entities coming as the most similar ones.So I am just I am dead. This would I would use this for both audio collection item matching the subject to the work Associated and also possibly for what do you call the key phrase filtration early phase filtration though, but but performing the the computer to have that I was I was referring to some couple of weeks back. I think this sounded more stable than populating all the key phrases now. We need to figure out a way to. Entities to the non named entity key phrases if at all that competition is possible. I will share I will share some at least if he root by to day after possibly this week has been I will spend as significant time on this one to to see where it takes us. I think the Janice of everything again, it is Janice n yeah. I think that is it from my side. Okay So sure okay so you can update whenever saw okay yeah. With any are we were planning to have a bug model for any. Okay Youre planning to have using the box model. Just take the data for any training which is available and then convert to case and to work for. That is reasonable, but I am just trying to but start because I is very nicely. So so if we by some pre processing that they pay some you know for spending some time on the data be that would be more stable data tests and this that is that is very much possible because even I as I as I posted to this morning even the bird model case sensitive. But that is because of data is to drink that I had. Because because the Validation data or in the writing data I was imagine also this morning the valuation is itself happen on that kind of data so they they get ninety ninety back. So we need to what try to do is take the same bit of it. So trying to you know try to deny it and and and see if we can stabilize it and then use the data for so I think done first I am recognition. Which data is could be same the oil yeah. So if if the first works for every mind what I can do is I can even take or maybe if I am not on what thinking right dont open here it has load get it on the user is it yes yeah, we can do that. I am not sure because right right now least to prove whatever what we call to prove whether it will help us to form and also the topics topic are arrived least if we comments get within this week I think we should we can take the task of trying that models. Probably we have to we are done with with this deployment one of one can take it. But should not make any difference right like it does not matter the domain. Instance is only based on similarity instance is based on the similarity the ping just taking it out. I think out what is the more more similar in other notes if if I if I do a if I do a participant. Like high level that means I do not I do not look at the most similar one if I look at the top drop one right okay. The fairways actually see if you are if you are talking about compute graph. We do pairwise similarity, but we do not form wedges between everything. Not I do not think we can do that how that we need to figure out a different but that but we have to learn minute is. No way I am talking about even if you have to do pairwise that is only to invest the graph of. The online representations the real thing we have to do at the community level hierarchy has to be well if if whatever what you are trying to do is if it is so independent of the timeline we should be able to use use that place out there. Yeah, let me just see if we can discuss gonna to show you something. So yeah this is what it is. Guarantee from from the same and then under the hero. The features is actually like taking I think all the symptoms that we missed about Microsoft okay, then and then after code. I will ready go there feature this to found different the word microsoft. So yeah, that is what it just works but we see how good it integrates with the how how good we can actually extend this to a slack data right monitor testing on on a relatively model and I was kind of okay I just need to tested this this this the one just your thing currently. But when you are taking the feature letter for the Node one that is the direct feature vector of the key or know. It restart exactly that is actually the that is wherever is there has correct. It has been like Nineteen articles okay maybe within actively and what but it has like maybe it has like four or five entries for. During instance, you take the mean of everywhere as you in the segment or something. Within meeting me I think we can even compare it with the sentence in which it if yeah single. Under the main comparison you are doing we on those feature that is also so that you not do not make any image much. I need to figure out a way to compare this to the key actually we just because like it. Maybe I think for some would be parallel working of it. So that he is is on what I thought we can we can just do separately and then because that testing been accelerating I and then we will see what go comes up. I think if you want you can I think I will.Make a copy of this and then share it you can you can check this and let me know what you think. Yeah when you had asked me to do a comparison between models as they were training how they performed on ether sync. So it turns out that training is actually very helpful. If you take pretty out of the box like the pins are really bad even the calls are horrible with I mind S c my dot and if we take the S e model it becomes better but performed greatly on ether Thursday calls and if we take ether and ether heard it performed service. That seems really obvious but but to know that traffic. I I think that is good because so yeah watch watch that is the model based ether mind even one about forms that has well. You can do one first conversion between whatever was whatever like what what three was test right like like he the was a and then you can do the same on ether calls with we call share the results on ether things with the I mentioned a model based mind and ether the ether model based. Yeah if that is what it knows then you can can just share it maybe you can it and. When I doing all comparison right this G kind of around testing calls I mind specific for that particular domain which the call was started. We can just what our mind that is to be to stay till just just pick pick the mind pick for for anything. Okay, but I call this in which you think are relevant relevant to the ether testing call or whatever sprint and called L is got. Because I do not have ether engineering model in GB whereas and word i have that and. Before I used to do with just the yeah like this bird and with. I think now you can use this ether engineering mind if one of them is convinced that we can go ahead our okay sure yeah. The last thing is I did the Vector conversation of the teams approach and it is actually provided lot of speed. So for video hundred thousand feature vectors us the old takes six seconds where the new approach takes about three hundred fifty minutes seconds. So if a order we have will to sentence comparisons that should have yeah. Okay So this add that to any any new deployment right sure add to the maybe it can you could just share that with three so that we can add whatever expect. With the GDP deployment rights keep more deployments should be like make everything aspects right now. Like the current one one is not. We can make it fix yeah we do not have problem with there no no, we did not see any that is all we did not finish with it. These things are not yet in the report it least in the master right. In the staging topic we can replace okay yeah.

Dont how any with having but engine General communities. Yeah, it is was giving good results. I just few meetings so in that I also observe that we are able to say generated good groups are coming up and the general call the development. The segments go with instances as code low so by was paying outfit with as a sentence level and I group the scale of four changes but generally does not behavior. Brand able to distinguish domain out of the and that case. See you shared one meeting and which I think why not groups that. So in that I saw that the bad group called load. Think one you showed like this case, it is not enough for us simple to know we have to have some there to actually remove the. Checking of that, but it not thing to do but what I of is but that my showing will be on on the model in this model in this case I saw that is with below point seven while back. We have to do yeah so do you have any audio call the reference meetings on which can check call you that is already shared and he is doing it. Waiting from normal podcasts to sinks and then normal sentencing these kind of things. Yeah that is a good Validation right at least from the ID perspective. And those meeting you will not find generate groups. There are very few meeting will will you will find you define generated groups to week but we entered that we already but most in in in in a. And model out of the domains would usually go down and that is that is fine should we even worry about the. So one one thing which I was trying to say is like if you have only five to six groups and you do not have any current score implementation. So we are trying to score these groups with mine then the out of domain are irrelevant one is would like if you have only three groups put come down but we need to have some way to remove them and throw only what what. Let is do this okay let us not worry about removing out of domain segment for now let us let us try to be able to. Let is let us be every ram for properly right as. Rank is I think it is related you that get the brand, but what she expecting it. It is that we have to see what we and i. But that anyway, we we we have not it really given a serious part to that never tried. So we have always let on rank. So but now let us figure correct. Let let it go to do you have any other concerns right i know earlier we used to have lot of segments rank so the library back one.

So offering engineering will be deployed first into production. Once these two are once we have that but done with this. Then we will stick those dropping summer and do that really.

We can make it fix yeah we do not have problem with there no no, we did not see any that is all we did not finish with it. These things are not yet in the report it least in the master right. In the staging topic we can replace okay yeah. Yeah, we can and then and then we can use it yeah.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"nsp\\\\\\\\\\\": false}\\\"}', 'url': 'https://lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2015-03-31/functions/mind-01dadp74wfv607knpcb6vvxgtg/invocations', 'context': {'client_region': 'us-east-1', 'client_config': <botocore.config.Config object at 0x7f97bfabec10>, 'has_streaming_input': True, 'auth_type': None}}\"}\n"

I have found unable in the graph with only the proper using and model ent*ty recognition. I may to found the good graph and then and then out of curious they just tried extending that tool ether you know, slack channel engineering channel. So what happened was even if even if a call even if the name ent*ty properly identify is not present in the software engineering it is able to it is able to find the close name ent*ties with certain conference. So that means if if I put it the a now you know point five on on the distance so anything about that is actually getting usually what what that new name take my trigger to so this could be called this could be like a festival opportunity which get out any high, but if I know it could be whatever what session is working on he he's also looking into the same thing so once once he available can we can just understand something.

This would I would use this for both audio collection item matching the subject to the work Associated and also possibly for what do you call the key phrase filtration early phase filtration though, but but performing the the computer to have that I was I was referring to some couple of weeks back.

I spent some time on named ent*ty, which which I wanted it for action detection to so first and then to to a*sociate objective with the verb in the process actually I have I think if I was telling you this both the week our last right named ent*ties wherein. I have found unable in the graph with only the proper using and model ent*ty recognition. I may to found the good graph and then and then out of curious they just tried extending that tool ether you know, slack channel engineering channel. So what happened was even if even if a call even if the name ent*ty properly identify is not present in the software engineering it is able to it is able to find the close name ent*ties with certain conference. So that means if if I put it the a now you know point five on on the distance so anything about that is actually getting usually what what that new name take my trigger to so this could be called this could be like a festival opportunity which get out any high, but if I know it could be whatever what session is working on he he's also looking into the same thing so once once he available can we can just understand something.

I think this can be used without doing any literal string match that means even if you have you know, some all it needs is the context of three or four sentences in which the name where it is used if the context is found in slack most likely you might find a reference to the closest match to that within the software engineering mind, even if it is, you know DeLorean it is actually I've seen some, you know video audio based entities coming as the most similar ones.So I'm just I'm dead. This would I would use this for both audio collection item matching the subject to the work Associated and also possibly for what do you call the key phrase filtration early phase filtration though, but but performing the the computer to have that I was I was referring to some couple of weeks back.

If you take pretty out of the box like the pins are really bad even the calls are horrible with I mind S c my dot and if we take the S e model it becomes better but performed greatly on ether Thursday calls and if we take ether and ether heard it performed service. \n",

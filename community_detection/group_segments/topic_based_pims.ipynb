Let's see.  audience  I think yeah, it's just you know.  They once you tested you just let me know then we can then I can rebase or whatever it is. Yeah mind. There are.  Here's our love Geneva III. This is getting hard so our time because I have lot of small small commits that I have built up.  What happens is when I rebates it goes supplies on top of every commit and have the kids.  I just take the current development mode it to my Visa bans because all the comments in one shot and then merge it back to dollar.  You do get it much. Okay, okay.  So I had the problem I think last time also because I generally keep small small combats with more descriptive anymore what's changing but I have a lot of comment generally in a feature Branch. So when I went everywhere be in a very committed I'm getting rebates or acts like conflicts. Correct? Pretty much resolve all the commit history in my teacher, but who did much develop that means from a feature branch? I was at the other Branch into my feature Branch resolve the conflicts in one shot and then  one more coming  As a magic away, that's the most common and then feature branch is resolved. So then the dimension we March back.  A lot of people say it's better because you don't know destructive editing. That means you're not changing the commit history because of rebase and just try to avoid the next recommend impossible. That's one of the better side.  But at some point you can still do it gets crash, right?  We can squash the question is do squash after the reviewer before the so for me I prefer to people to see like small small keep committing incrementally. So people see the changes so I don't squash before.  Better you must because a lot of code changes exact similar file similar lines.  reading in the museum  Yeah, yeah - inter-korea have to commit symbol.  And also like it'll help you because I'm screwing some of the checks and validation if you need it. Anyways, neither.  I understand that.

      "So I started testing GPT is ability to capture either data along with SE data by combining the data sets and then painting the model. So we found that training with a combination of two plus one second sentences in the IROC manner allowed it to capture context as update some of the tokens but this order to capture context or an entity level. Whereas as a new directly Feed The Entity and you get it. A decent enough representation this I double-checked by comparing giving an entity and taking the most similar entity. So this works well for the most part but in terms of actual sentence to sentence comparisons, it doesn't make that much of a difference whether we use the in incremental approach or this approach. So the only place actually see a difference is in this entities comparison. So that's something we want to take a look at.  2 8 7 \n",

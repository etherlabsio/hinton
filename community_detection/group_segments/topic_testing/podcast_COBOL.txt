Or let me go back to where I was at when my JCL and I can use what's called a fast path. And if I know the option is 13, I can hit equals 13. It takes me to the same spot now. I need to hit o to look at my output Q naught 0. Oh and now I need to do a find on my particular job. And that was a y and I see two outputs and let me see. What's going on? With my COBOL. I'm just going to hit select by the COBOL in order to scroll down. I need to hit f8. ",

That was initiated from my JCL job card. And then right here is the actual output of my program. So let me put an S out here beside that and we should see one line of code saying welcome YouTube to the IBM Mainframe hit enter and that's exactly what we see here in the SDS F output. So this is the code that's generated from that display statement that I had in the simple YouTube COBOL program. I'm going to hit F3. In and I can do one or two things to look at my output created from the compilation Link at it and go of my COBOL program. I wrote if I hit s and then enter and I hit f8, I get a long list of information which is useful in certain certain instances. If you need to find errors with the JCL and things at the very bottom here is the code of my COBOL program that was compiled. Old and we see actually that display statement that was executed to get that welcome YouTube to the IBM Mainframe there. However, if I didn't want to Traverse through all that information, I mean hit F3 again and instead of an S right here. I'm going to hit a question mark and what a question mark does it breaks that output into individual segments. So if I wanted to see the code that's generated from my link edit procedure or step and my JCL job card. I could come in here, too. S right here in dinner or more than likely what you're going to be able to what's going to help you out. The most is if you see in your ",

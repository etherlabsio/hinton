Let's move on to our animation section and give you example that you are already using of the API. Now, let's try to understand. What is this API and we are going to use a simple example that you some of you might have already used. So let me bring up my own website here, which is learn code online dot gain. Now some of you might have already registered on this website and I would just say welcome self-promotion. So now let's just carry on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. We use a kind of a feature known as sign up. Now this sign of feature is pretty common. You just register with your name email address password and then I sent you a confirmation email at your email and you just click on that to verify that is kind of the my way of handling the sign up pretty common nothing so important nothing so much series to learn about that pretty common feature now on the other hand now, let's bring up.Google now as we all know that Google is a gigantic website it writes a lot lot and lot of good. We all know that this kind of code. Is there on the Google for variety of purposes maybe for search engine maybe for using Google Docs maybe for logins. I know there's tons of features on the Google Now, we also know that there is one of the very important feature in the Google which is sign-in feature. You probably have been using data for Gmail or YouTube. So there is a login feature already being cooked up by the Google.So one of the code feature is login system. Now if somehow I can use the Google login system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying of the user authentic authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. And if you notice that on our website, which is learned code online dot in we use a feature known as sign up.",

And the people who are using the API will be saying that hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point to understand now, here's the problem the people who are already using the API don't need to understand.Is API because they know about it, but the people who don't understand the API. We need to Target that people we need to make sure that they understand so let me give you a quick example and I'll give you two examples we will move on to our animation bored very quickly, but the example of the API is very simple now Epi is something which is helping you to have a seamless connectivity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing. But that API is actually helping now. Remember the example this one only always that when you try to book an airline ticket or maybe a railway ticket, you booked it from a various web site. Let's say you want to fly from Jaipur to Delhi or Jabbar to Mumbai and you choose your favorite Indigo Airlines. But how many times do you actually book from Indigo Airlines? You rarely does that you use other services like make my trip.com or maybe go everywhere.com or any other sub services. So how is that possible that you are booking from the third party website, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane. The answer is. ",

If everybody will be able to use these kinds of a for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply lean use or some may use it for not them person as well. So there's one more concept that sometimes is changes also known as C D I t now a P I t is again a method right I sign up on the Google and take the permission of the approval day I want to reach a logic feature and do him this say hey no problem at all I'll give you a need a T I T so that if you make an announcement activity. I can track you and get shut you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the APi keywords. So yes, this is it. This is here API now there's no such stream on with the API. It's the simplest thing in the world, but yes, the destination has made it so complex here well on to summary knows I would say that he a I is just a code by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being written why is being or what the second would have been that why this people have it in this code all I hear about is is if someone else code that he's meaning giving me permission.",

Well that problem is whenever you are designing a project it works absolutely fine in your machine the developer machine, but as soon as that project is being moved on to the production state may be on two servers or maybe somebody's else computer. Maybe your friend is or maybe your team managers computer in that case the project usually fails to work with the same performance or save optimization or the same level of working. Even when that project is moved from one place to another place. Although here. We are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no Django pipe in JavaScript and all those stuffs, but just to give you a bare minimum basic example, whenever you develop any web site using PHP or maybe asp.net whenever you work on that project and move that project onto the web server. There are definitely some Martin's uncertainties that hackers may be or images are not being loaded properly Maybe.Father is a little bit different or glitchy in some of these cases that is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine, but as soon as it moved to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine this further brings the classic debate of developer saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check and while putting the project onto the production or any other machine the other guy says, hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine first and foremost Docker is just completely a different thing and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight.",

I'm not going to put any satellite into the space and that is going to calculate with the whole complexity things and going on there and we'll give me the data where we will it rain or will it not rain? So under Tony Stark. I'm not going to put a satellite up there. But what I can do is some people have done that already and I can use their API is now some of the apis are free and some of them are not like sign up with a Google is a free tier that you can use but if you want to use the Google database and want to fix up everything on there like live database that we call as a live reloading database. That's some of the part is free for the fire.Base and we'll talk about the Firebase in some other movies and but if your user base is growing you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is their little bit but onto a whole let's forget about all that thing and focus again on API. So now you understand that API is a code written by someone else and you can use that code in your application. And that is it now sometime in that application. You have to use an API key as well so that the misuse of that code or that feature is not there. Okay. So I hope you have understood what is API and from now onwards you will never ever look on. What is API rather you will be looking on the things that how I can use that API that would be much more important. So Basics all clear up and maybe in some of the videos. I will try to make sure that you understand how apis are being used as well.let me know in the comments of comment section down below that from which language you might want to utilize that feature like whether we should use a.

The links are in the description below so that I can post in the on my Facebook page that what will be the timing of going life because I hope you can understand I have other works as well that I have to accomplish as well. But yes, I'll try to make sure that. You get the timing and most people can join up. In fact, I would be the happiest person to see that. Hey more people and more people are attending the live sessions. So with this notify me in the comment section there how you like the idea of going life and follow up follow me up on my page as well so that I can give you exact timing then I would be like and with this I will surely catch you in the next video.Hey did everyone of these your back again with another video? And in this video? We're going to talk about Docker after watching this video. I promise you that the concept of the docker will be absolutely clear to you and by the end of the video, I will also share one experience.

The portability is one of the absolute charm of the docker. Now you can take this container and wherever you are going to put this container it's going to work absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the or machine. Not only that Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your Instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. Well, the classic example is whenever you're learning MySQL installing the MySQL can be very challenging and not talking about the PHP Pascal package. I'm talking about just the core MySQL it one of the most challenging thing to install onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot camps. That was somebody's running Windows Mac and Linux. It's not an easy process to do. So, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker so docker. Is a software that allows you to create these container and these containers are not just any container. They are super powerful and are super packed up and consist a lot of things. These containers are packed up with your code your dependencies your configuration some of the processes that you are running some of the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases. It also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order to summarize we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you number one thing. It's a client-side application program. You can just install the docker and it can does all the things for you including designing a container for you and you don't have to worry about anything all of your codes and can think will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed on to any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like Docker also act as a social networking platform.",

I will share some of the personal experience with the doctor as well. So here we go now once I was teaching this amazing class of the students where we had to install some of the C++ library and our goal was to interact with the mongodb using the C++ drivers and some of the library now in case you have worked any time with a C++, you know, it's a nightmare because C++ is not an easy thing to take down and specially when you have to interact with the drivers of mongodb, you need to install couple of more things not just GCC but as ton of other libraries that need to be installed now our goal was to learn that how we can use these drivers into the C++ and the brain was that we used was grow now Crow is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even. Starting a hello world in the group. So what I did for saving some time for the entire student and for me in that boot camp was to deploy a simple Docker machine of The Crow and I thought the student that how the initial basics of the darker works and within a few moments they were able to download my socially shared Docker machine of the crow with the hello world already configured and process everything into it and we were just on the go. So the training that could have used just my entire week in a training the student about how to configure the group or the first time. It just save me a lot of time because the goal was not to understand the crow, but rather to understand the API integration of mongodb and C++. I'll share the link in the description below. It's a little bit outdated image that I created probably little while ago it says hello Crow and it's almost 9 months old but still works absolutely like a chance. So in case you are interested in that, I'll post a link in the description and in case you are interested to take a class about soccer and they. ",

So if you type / either space summarize space and you paste a zoom link what you would see is at We will you see the message saying hey, it has accepted your request and your processing the zoom limb and after we've gone through the entire pipeline of crossing the call will push back the link to the zoom link to the summary and all the details about the pens and markers. So that's been done that's been tested. So the next item is for us to figure out if we can directly look up meeting ideas when someone creates a slash Zoom called slack and use that as a hook for giving back. The recording was the meeting is over started so you can avoid the mine Olympic venues manual entry is maybe after this call while this is a casting shine you made mom. She can talk for like how to approach that. Yeah. So was I what I'm trying to do is look at ",

And from there. I will go on to aggregate sentences that these entities are a part of so essentially what you have is these mines are individual nodes say or Docker node, kubernetes node and an SQL node. So as a segment comes in will be able to attribute say or Docker note to a doctor segment and this will allow us to tag topics as well as given importance of each segment as they come in. So this is just as in the initial stages of identifying the entities and the other parameter right now. So so now we do this when we replace a severe Spacey interpretation of this we will have to see if because I'm currently using a Transformer baste the bird model for identifying entities and if that works out well, then we can go ahead and replace this because right field on our data it should give us a high level.

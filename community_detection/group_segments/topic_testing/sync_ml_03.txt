It misses out some of the good descriptive key. So I was looking at expanding that same pattern or somehow integrating that into this one as a filter. So like so even if you get like a bigger descriptive then run it against this to have a cleaner recorder or something and yeah, and so apart from that so the vocabulary thing what I was approaching was similarly they called in on phrases and then n then n piece plus name it is and then so we build all core graph out of it. Now with call I'm basically connect. So if there is any new unknown ent*ty which gets like for word or if we get something like I ent*ty d, which is person or something then connect to the nearby yeah with.

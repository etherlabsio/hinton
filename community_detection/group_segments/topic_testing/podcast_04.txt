The portability is one of the absolute charm of the Docker. Now we can take this screener and wherever you're going to put this container, it's gonna work absolutely. And exactly like how it worked on the Yamashita. Not only that, Docker also allows you to have social containers. What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social platform. The classic example is whenever you are learning my SQL installing the mine, Eskil can be very challenging and not talking about the phD Maskell package and talking about just the core, my askew. Well, it's one of the most challenging thing to instal onto a system, and I personally have felt in the boot camps that while somebody's running Windows, Mac and relax, it's not easy process to do so. That process can be done frictionless with the help of Docker. So Docker is a software that allows you to create these container. And these containers are not just any container. They're super powerful and our super packed up and consists a lot of things. These container, our act of video code, you're dependencies. Your configuration from the process is that you are running from the networking information that you're running and in some of the special cases, it also consists of the chunk of some of the operating system that is responsible of tweaking out some things in your code. So in order, summarise, we can divide this Docker into three main essential thing that it does for you. Number one thing. It's a client side application programme. You can just instal the Docker, and it hinders all the things for you, including designing at container for you. Any don't have to worry about anything, call up their codes and conflict will be packed and you can just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking platform, just like. ",

While that problem is, whenever you're designing a project, it works absolutely fine in your machine developer machine.

In that case, the project usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimisation or the same level of working, even when their project is moved from one place to another place. Although here we are talking about the big scale projects that include something like no django pipes in Javascript in although stun well, just to give you a bare minimum. Basic example, whenever you develop any website using P h p or maybe a s p dot nerd whenever you work on their project and moved that project onto the Web server, there are definitely some urgent uncertainties that occurs, maybe, or images are not being loaded properly. Maybe the path is a little bit different or glitchy. In some of these cases. It is a classic example when everything works on the developer machine. But as soon as it moves to another place, it doesn't work like that. So the classic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the classic debate of developer, saying It works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come in cheque, and while putting that project onto the production or any other machine, the other guy says, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies that you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically address this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely at different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language or any project that you are working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed airtight container. ",

Now pro is not an easy framework to install deploy and just even starting a seller world in the grow.

What is the purpose of this thing as zoom you have an application later on in which is a application and you want to interact with a newly standalone system which is running on dot net framework. So how these two systems can connect communicate the code can be easily converted into dot net and then these two programming running languages or these two applications can talk to each other seamlessly. So that is a beauty what microsoft dot net was providing or supporting so hope you learn about what is dot net and wide dot net. Thank you very much for watching the video.",

Well, indeed it is a room, but not just any hotel room that you can find united States, but instead a very very nice hotel room inside of so some you guys know this already, but I've been teaching a a technology camp for high school students and college freshmen on how to program for the very first time at least first some of the are using slip and ios s u ui Git. So in today's video I kinda of went to talk to you guys about some of the difficulties and challenges of teaching high school how to program personally I don't have a ton of experience teaching high school. So I definitely walk away from this experience with a much better understanding on how beginners kind of approach programming and what their perspective is on the whole topic the software development right. So one of the things that I found a little bit difficult and also a bit of a challenge it was taking the language of slip to a customer of spin that it didn't really have a ton of exposure to programming. It's itself. Now some of the things that I understand very very easily and some of you guys that are more experienced also understand very easily these things that don't come to do as quickly as we would help. So for example, some things such as functions is statements for this variables scope and also cla*ses and stress. So days things are actually placed to difficult for beginners to understand so I kind gained a much better perspective on how to teach that don't know how a program exactly what these things are alright so the second thing that I realized was that golden.",

So what I got did for this cla*s was you go through first half to build out basic ui with codes and then we are moved out to sort words and how use actions put together really really simple application. So one very very common column that kept coming up with all this how to use some of these methods such as number of rows and self or road at index path when we have approached how to use UI table and another thing I came up was exactly what's detail will do data kill when billing out our table is when not using a controller. So funny thing it is that some of these same problems also occurred inside the San Francisco boot chat that I taught last year and the funny thing is all of these issues kind of resolved itself after a couple of days when the students finally get a chance to go over some exercise themselves and see exactly how will be worse when trying to build out a simple applications on their own okay so the third challenge that I've found to be kind interesting was going a lot of algorithm. So with these kids and trying to get them to sync and an algorithm way. So personally only I like to learn how to kind of understand a new program language by colleagues through very very simple and basic exercise such as you know, for example how to find the largest value inside of an array integer values. So this is going to involve you know perhaps a four and statement and Valley, maybe return ether certain knowledge. So if you don't know how a.",

Thankfully. It's not hard to take advantage of machine learning today. The Toy has gotten quite good all you need is data developers and a willingness to take the punch for our purposes. I shortened the definition of machine learning dancers five words using data to answer questions while I wouldn't use such a short answer for an on exam. It serves a useful purpose for us here in particular we can split the definition into two parts using data and ask for questions these two pieces broadly outline the two sides of machine learning both of them equally important using data is what we refer to as well answering questions is referred to as making predictions or inference. Now let's grill into those two sides briefly for a little bit training refers to use our data to inform the creation and fine tuning of a predictive model this predictive model can then be used to serve up predictions on on unseen data enhance those questions and as more data gathered the model can be improved over overtime and new predictive models deployed as you may have noticed the key component of this entire process is data everything hinges on data data has the key unlock machine learning trust as much as machine learning is the key unlocking that hidden insight in data this was just a high level overview of machine learning.",

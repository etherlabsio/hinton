So one method that we were thinking of was like like you're taking the slack graph slack data is the base ground truth data and then try to like been an entity graph kind of structure with we have like we base all the other connection all the key phrase connections to The Entity. He's so and so basically like if there is something called Janus has an entity then we look for key phrase that are like Co occurring within a certain particular cycle of windows. So we might get like a noun phrases like recording record or surveys or recording client and all those stuff. So we EV form connections of this odd, and we try to and Like, you know keep reinforcing it like we tried to populate it every time as and genuine say if it is like rub then as in when it's like data comes in or if it is meeting graph. Then hasn't been meeting data comes in and then we put a filter that if the edge number of edge connection frequency if it is more than say four or five and use it. So this the connection between entity and key phrase is a valid one. So based on that we can whenever we get a highlight which Is like a bad word like a Sufi or something we go back and check in the graph. So ideally we expect that Sookie will have like lesser number of edge connections and we move. ",

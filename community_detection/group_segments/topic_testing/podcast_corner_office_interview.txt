Now your host Jason Miller. I guess today, Roman Krishna. The CEO of Paul's secure. Welcome to the program at date. Thanks for having me. This discussion we're having today is a little different than my normal view from a corner office discussion, usually I have a government contractor, but post is a government vendor, which is a little different. We'll get into that in a little bit. But let's start maybe at the beginning you guys do work with the federal government usually through value added sellers and other partners, but it's still good time for even a few vendors like yourself to be in the Federal market tell me why it is good time to be a government vendor. The Federal market has always been a very important market for secure, but also for other major security when the federal government and the Federal sector generally tends to be a pioneer in many cases and an early adapter of security solutions. Obviously there's a lot of challenges that are being faced by the telecom and broadly speaking the commercial sector as well be it related to the increase of the types and the depth and the complexity of the threats that they're facing what I would call inside a challenges, meaning the separation of the Federal enterprise itself from outside and an inside perspective leading to the thrust around zero trust which again, the payment government there has been big prominent off and then the adoption of mobile technologies and cloud for.",

So to speak that results in if all these things are happening. Am I compliant whether it is to my internal audit needs or external audit need to compliance becomes a bigger and bigger issue that everybody has to to worry about so these combined with the economic challenges you mentioned budget in the federal sector. But in the commercial sector always tend to be quite tight as well and so what what does cloud mean can I use the cloud and save dollars become more efficient as an example, so that at the same time increases complexity from a security example, so these are some of the broader trends that are happening and the important thing from Vendor community standpoint is make things more simple even as you keep them secure to enable customers to manage these things better and give customers option don't force them into the cloud or don't them into a data center adopt hybrid approaches and give seamless access to those custom couple interesting things I wanna pull the on let me start with obviously the increasing number of threats. We've seen that for last. You know five or ten years but the freedom side and I think that's something that the government the federal government is just starting to come to groups with that and you're seeing a big push for citizen services user experience and things like that how did you as a security Vendor kinda listen to what the government is saying and take you that into account as you're developing products and and solutions freedom in this particular context comes on.",

Obviously result in the ability for somebody like us to solve these problems and in that in that context of fairly government and the federal sectors is a very large opportunity for us. Now it's interesting you say that the government has maybe been an early sometimes security companies and other technology companies. We'll say the Government's always a step behind because they are risk of they don't wanna have failure. So they wanna adopt something they know is security a little different based on the breaches. We've seen whether it's the V reach from two thousand six of the reached from twenty fifteen that has pushed them to be more of on the front end of security definitely jason. It has pushed them into the into the forefront of security. I would say and because as you know even at the National Government level at the Congress level security in various forms. Sometimes these are international threat. So to speak or the general standard security for information protect access capabilities, etcetera are all relevant the government also has to be very efficient in terms of delivering and adopting new technologies like cloud and hybrid as an example or even mobile technologies. So the locking down of the areas and creating wall gardens is no longer practical even in the federal sector. And so the way I think about it is when people say their are risk covers that way have a describe is that they are risk aware as opposed to risk and in the context of being listed aware if they can be diligent about who the security providers are and ensure that they are going through the right integrations etc then the speed of delivery and deployment increases and.",

I'm a little surprised you didn't say the budget so many people when I talk ask the same first question every time you is had a good time to be a federal contractor everyone says well, we have budget uncertainty or the fact is we know the budget looks like or they just got a budget deal done that that affects you a lot less than maybe a more quote traditional government contractor doesn't it in many respects. Yes, although even as a vendor we would like for better predictability on the budgets and the speeding up of the budget process and the allocation to them as well because we work with other bags and larger failure contact and the degree that their impacts did we get impacted as well the and the significance of the benefit like viewing to the table is we had a very diversified business. So while the federal set is a very important factor for us as a vendor. We have a very large commercial presence as well and we are always trying to call it cross meaning the trends and the technologies that we built for the commercial sector. We try to see how they can apply to the fairly sector. And to the degree that we learn about things in the federal sector. We try to take them back to the commercial sector. So in many ways we tend to be unique in that respect and so to your point about budgets etcetera we are able to diverse higher business because of our presence in more than eighty percent of the fortune five hundred for instance that allows us to take things into the fairly sector and vice versa you bring up trends. I think that's a great the segue way to the next question because what are some of the trends you are seen whether from the commercial to the Federal or vice versa as you know is a very fashion.",

I would say even faster than many other sectors lemme me highlight a few and happy to elaborate on some as you please first one I would say is the security challenges that customers are facing. Let's start with the commercial factor are increasing at rates that has never been seen before that is further complicated i would say many ways by the demand from the customers customers for more freedom and less control meaning that I want to be using a device wherever I am located I want you to move my applications to the cloud i want you to deploy a hybrid policy etcetera a*sets. Some of it is economics some of it is user experience some of it is simply user preference and all those things what happens is that it complicates security policy. It makes it more difficult for companies to ensure that their security posture is proper and protected. So that's one key aspect but the other side of the point is that companies have fewer resources to deploy and make useful these solutions. So on one hand the number of security solutions is growing on the other hand customers have fewer people and your resources to manage all this so the implication from a vendor community standpoint make things incredibly easy to use make things more integrated don't make your customers environment your test labs. I mean those are all things that we subscribe to very deeply and strive to support our customers and make their lives simpler.

So that's broadly called hybrid. I T or hybrid security in this particular context. So that's a level of freedom we need to provide to everybody including the federal sector because that's becoming an increasingly important requirement. Obviously there's an economic dimension to budget dimension to it as well on the other side I would call them end users requiring freedom and that could be be use my mobile device be it use my system from anywhere be it local be remote be in another country without compromising my security posture and giving me freedom to be productive freedom. Essentially equates to simplicity which them allows you to email productive what we have done is on the end user side we have client software that is identical across all platforms.

We teeny find that they off by a factor of two or three and in some cases in factor of ten in many cases. So what happens is that that really creates a moment for them saying if I don't even know what trying to connect to my network how will I ever be able to protect it and that is really the visibility challenge and that's greatly exacerbated by the whole Iot trend or as you said connected internet and where on one hand. I say it is very good and very productive for all of these devices to be connected to the internet right. Simply because it makes administrators life in terms of understanding various forms of connections connectivity and usage that much more simpler, but with that kind of freedom comes the complexity of what is the security capabilities of these devices they're running the right types of software how can I attach policy to that all those things become very important.

So you're separating always the person from the business that also is an option that we give to the federal sector where they are able to not have to a lot more devices than they absolutely need to and then worry about how they lock them down so that's another form of freedom that both types of freedom that we discussed let's take a quick break when we come back we can jump into some of those other things you talked about in terms of trends.

I also think to a large degree it is the obligation of vendors such as ourselves to be able to articulate these things simply to the federal sector and others and highlight how we are adding value to them rather than pushing a specific product or a point solution to them in other words if we work backwards from this concept which we define internally as customer success and doing what's right and solving their problems, including integrating with third party Vendors. We will be able to accelerate the their journey and so it's a combination of really solving the problem and then mapping it on to their particular problems and environment are there other pieces of that technology model or the or the or the business model that you're seeing that they're starting to really change as you spend more time in the Federal market. So as we think a lot the business models themselves increasingly. I feel there is a greater awareness business models like subscription for instance, even in the federal sector, which I will not have said a few years ago but I think this is a bleed so speak from the commercial factor into the Federal sector where more and more customers again, either budget constrained or not thinking about subscription based models as well as agencies that offer services to other agencies thinking about pay as pay grow type models as well that requires both the aggregate and contractors is to adapt and adopt new business which then obviously translates to us as well on our side because of the fact that we've done all of this on the commercial sector.

It's not aiming one technology, but what are you seeing from when you talk to agencies about zero trust and it is becoming increasingly at top of mind topic traditional way of looking at security was you had an enterprise boundary or a parameter call it of wall garden every bit of traffic that comes from outside the enterprise per was deemed unsafe for insecure by definition and therefore had to be protected and authorized on the everything that was inside the parameter was deemed secure and should have three access increasingly what's happening and this happened a lot more in the commercial sector is that more and more threat starting from inside the network think of a very simple case I'm working on my computer at home. I get infected by something happening on the internet. I come inside the network parameter meaning inside my office open up my laptop and I have the danger of interacting the entire system. So that's becoming increasingly prevalent and there are many more sophisticated ways of doing that, but I'm giving you a very basic example that is leading to this notion of AI I icon. I can't trust traffic coming from the outside nor should I trust anything that's inside leading to the concept of zero trust while on one hand everybody's beginning to be aligned on zero trust. What it also creates is what is the best way most economical way and simply put the most secure way of addressing this zero trust challenge and that's what when is like us and.",

I would actually humbly submit that we and some others are actually addressing zero trust in a very comprehensive way right from the get go and increasingly as our portfolio use continue to evolve to support the the freedom requirement that we spoke back both for administrators and end users of what we're are really doing now is mapping what we do to the concept of zero trust. So in other words. This is not a case of a new concept coming up and then everybody catching up to it. We are all figuring out how to reinforce and emphasize what we do in the zero trust framework.

We hosted a customer council which included them and other commercial customers as well we do that routinely to essentially cross best practices between commercial and Federal there we went through our zero trust solutions. Not zero test plans so to speak and and simply put in in the approach that we take we and authenticate users which is the ident*ty problem that you highlighted devices to ensure that the devices that are connecting compliant and have the right security posture etcetera, etcetera applications to make sure that applications are authorized to be delivered in a certain way and used by the users and last but not least the networks. So users devices applications and networks are all authorized and provided access by our solutions. The combination of those will allow a customer to deploy a zero trust environment and so the more we are able to educate them in those terms and language that they already know they're getting more and more comfortable with leader trust and obviously derived the benefits of zero trust by not having wall. The gardens and not having different security policies for inside and outside. So we have taken that approach and while the adoption in the commercial sector has been faster.

We spoke about video trust happening or coming up in conversations on a more frequent basis. The way I would describe it is in the next two to three years zero trust will become much more of a prevalent deployment model in the Federal sector as well as in the commercial sector, but clearly in the sector for all the reasons that we discussed two is that some of the call it the traditional requirements because networks are not going to go away right away. So some of the traditional requirements, including things like a dot one requests comments mean etcetera will continue to evolve and a*sociated with that is end endpoint security and compliance even basic things like while I provide freedom to my end users to use any mobile device that they want. I need to have capabilities to ensure that the device is not J and for so point compliance endpoint security will be another key requirement and will become an ongoing and increasing requirement in the federal sector. We spoke about iot o t that I believe will be a very important requirement both from a visibility standpoint as well as what we would call it enforcement. So once you know what is connecting you want to take the mediation actions so that becomes an important element as well.

So to speak as you highlighted the contract will want to take us as the subject, but in many cases to the agencies that's number one number two is that over the years through a combination of a solution sprint as well as our focus on their success. We have direct access to them as well. So very I can't collect honestly a instance where that has been a problem for us that's good news because a lot of times. It's it's more likely for small businesses we hear this. But where the prime is is so territorial. They don't wanna bring anyone else and except for the prime contractor. Obviously it's it maybe different for bar or or for for a bigger company like yourself the other challenge that yeah, the other challenges ours is some of the flow requirements you have to deal with some of the procurement and other footer requirements or is that you deal with that anyways I guess just what I'm looking for is does the does you not selling directly to the government put any extra burden or compliance issues on your shoulders that you wouldn't normally have not necessarily Json and I mean we have a relationship with the aggregate as like D l solutions and and so our contracts are very very clear with them and then they kind of value add on the other side by either supporting us or shielding us from the sorta of their specific relationships with the agency. So in that regard. There's actually a benefit to working with with partners, but from time to time there are acceptance criteria etcetera that are pa*sed through. But that's completely fine because we own the very good almost at of time for let you go I do want to bring up one other piece of.",

Maybe was something that's typical give you a couple of scenarios that typical and one is customers has already deployed a solution to both our touch and the partners touch over the years and they're looking at. Let's say expanding slash modernizing right in those cases. It's a much simpler programming model because we are already in the environment and the customers looking to expand it still comes to us through the resource slash aggregate slash contractor, but it's a fairly straightforward. Then so to speak in other cases the contract that might have and feel. Let's call it a the agencies looking for increase then improved visibility. We been asked to respond with specific render solutions can you work with us on responding and creating a very comprehensive response to the agency. So that is the other form which is much more elongated at some level but we go through that process as well and in many cases present with our partner as well as the agencies need to take so those are the two typical models. It's it's rarely something where out of the blue they just come to us and say hey do you have something like this. It's interesting the two kind of paths you guys go down on to kind of get in front of the customer and and work with with your partners. How different is that then just bidding on your own did you guys ever think about maybe we would just sell directly to the government or have you always gone down the path of partners and value added sellers people gone down the path of partners and value resources you could say that to some degree that comes from our commercial heritage because in the commercial space.

So it's similar to like jeopardy and others, but it's not as structured and it was much more free flowing we used to enjoy that a lot because there was a certain camaraderie alternate and a certain level of creativity and exploration involved in it. So that is something that I don't think a lot of people know about me. So did you ever go out for jeopardy. No not not for here not yet at least right, but not yet yet at least yes. That's a more optimistic and was there a part of the trivial issue that you were special specialized in were you more about geography versus something else who knows I was more focused than history and sports so both Australia and history.

I am very optimistic that the federal sector will catch on the some of the business model friends in the commercial space. Some of the ones that we discussed including subscription, including as you go etcetera and all of this will need to be wrapped up in a our and automation framework providing better a**lytics and therefore better visibility to our customers. So these are some of the key requirements that we see emerging more and more and more in the federal sector. They will happen in various agencies at different speeds. But everybody seems to be trending in the same direction. It's interesting you brought up a better data a**lytics and I think that's a key thing that I see when I talked to all the time is a desire from more information but also the ability to understand and process that information. It's do you have that problem as a security vendor where you gotta be how do you find that right balance between not just over overloading your customers with security information but helping them understand what what it all means definitely this and I like to distinguish between information which is a slip call reporting. So and so data points or this is what happened etc versus this insights and our focus on a**lytics is much more on the insights of hey, this is what's happening. This is what could happen and this is what you must do to protect against anything bad from happening. So while there is still a lot of value to basic reporting increasingly because of the amount of information that is being given to everyone it is more critical to move it providing insights to our customers and that's our focus as it relates to a**lytics you brought up the fact that you guys don't sell necessarily directly to the government you worked through third parties value added sellers other partners talk about what the.",

So as I previously mentioned we go through a direct tax with our customers and indirectly full element so that's no different in the federal sector as well one of the advantages. Let me start with the positives of working with partners aggregate as contact this they add a lot of value to us in terms of the requirements of the federal sector meaning that they have many more feet on the street. They gather a lot more intelligent. So to speak and they're able to give it back to us such that we're able to build solutions that matter more to the federal sector. So that's a very important a benefit that we derived from our partner community. If you want to highlight kind of what could happen in the flip side the flip side is that we don't really have a awareness of visibility of everything that goes on at the end customer and sometimes we get slow down. Let's say by other vendors who might be in the process or call it the bureaucracy of the system. Sometimes and so in this particular case at least so far the positives is the negatives for us and we continue to work on how we make our relationship more efficient broader deeper etc and if anything we are trying to spend a network of partners and then we as needed can always go to our end customers and learn directly from missed well is not a challenge that if you call up. If you have a contract with somebody and a lot of times the agency will say we only want to do with the prime do you use that a problem for you guys then I say well if we need to talk to somebody in at the agency level we have to go through our primary contract.",

The way I would highlight it is that there is a meaningful call responsibility on part of all of us young or mature companies to truly understand the sector to understand your customers. So to speak right? So while you may have the the other transaction priorities etcetera, etcetera. It does not remove the responsibility on the vendors to actually understand the federal sector and try to work towards satisfying and those customers in other words understand what problems are solving under understand how we will be beneficial to the fairly sector and areas such as the O T a's etcetera are call it a means to an n not an end itself.

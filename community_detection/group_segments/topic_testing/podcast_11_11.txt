When we enter this year. You had called out how some car changes may cause you're over your girlfriend's to fluctuate from time to time and we haven't heard of a couple quarters. So as we look out towards like 2020 and Beyond you feel like a lot of the products here is in a good place as far as search and YouTube are concerned and that you know, these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future just make over there. And then on the third quarter de journee je the growth rate was solid but at lower than the prior Trends or anything notable to call out on a pack. Thank you. So in terms of the first question, you know, I think it's very I talked about we're pleased with the Strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter as we said since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results and will always do the right thing for the long term. We're very focused on investing for the long-term and tried to make it clear in opening comments that you know, as a result quarterly growth can bury and have buried and you know, I think to your question in our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you you've seen since the beginning of the year for us underscore the strengthen and the vibrancy actually in our business and that's particularly true at our size in the last 12 months. We've generated over a hundred fifty billion in total revenues. That's about 25 million of growth in the last year and we are continuing to invest in long-term opportunities it but you know, I make the point that we do keep a lens to the long term. \", \"transcriptId\": \"d2d8e51a-6204-4bab-9315-e2787a80db92\"}, {\"id\": \"42d3484104334aa69005c655f2c2b156\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-11T08:02:47Z\", \"duration\": 91, \"spokenBy\": \"b1e8787a9a1f4859ac11cbb6a8124fd9\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-11T08:02:48.491819515Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-11T08:01:16Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-11T08:03:30.052068748Z\", \"confidence\": 0.743994875, \"recordingId\": \"af6bd31bc4b34d2eb7cc8dddbf8aeb04\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-IN\", \"originalText\": \"Thank you.

Somebody talked about the new neural network techniques part of the biggest breakthrough in Search and years. You can help us understand if that's acting that the advertise your monthly anytime, you know, maybe I'll answer it does. The car which is the name of the technique we are using and we rolled it out in search now and it just you know, obviously anytime we can better make sense of queries, you know, we can serve users better search quality goes up and when people engage and it's okay engage more so it's part of a long-running set of things we've been working on but this is one of our bigger breakthroughs in terms of helping improve the search experience and search quality and roboticle. Us in a certain set of queries very many queries which are already working well, but it helps us capture nuance and help understand human context better. And so I would just get a price this as a big Improvement which improve search quality and creates that virtuous cycle by which people engage more. Of course A lot of times we take the same techniques and sometimes it makes sense of that ad side and down the line in machine learning techniques and will deploy it there as well. \", \"transcriptId\": \"d2d8e51a-6204-4bab-9315-e2787a80db92\"}, {\"id\": \"697004c05a6f45ca9ce2d42d99a3c1c7\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-11T08:09:25Z\", \"duration\": 3, \"spokenBy\": \"b1e8787a9a1f4859ac11cbb6a8124fd9\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-11T08:09:26.275345326Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-11T08:09:22Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-11T08:09:47.339706704Z\", \"confidence\": 0.7606185, \"recordingId\": \"86a9e8b2c9ac492ca7f96c83529a66cd\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-IN\", \"originalText\": \"Still in the earlier stages of testing. \", \"transcriptId\": \"d2d8e51a-6204-4bab-9315-e2787a80db92\"}, {\"id\": \"f3a89b9ecdd04514b6d9cc29fb5177d1\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-11T08:05:53Z\", \"duration\": 64, \"spokenBy\": \"b1e8787a9a1f4859ac11cbb6a8124fd9\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-11T08:05:54.237105903Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-11T08:04:49Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-11T08:06:35.557747728Z\", \"confidence\": 0.789796835, \"recordingId\": \"52f93b60c65e466db19052053c765554\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-IN\", \"originalText\": \"The time the percentage of time for which we were eligible are compared to two years ago to last year to now.

Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways. You can go and CP and just one follow-up with root you delivered it to some Gigi. Some G3 pricing changes and I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year and I was just curious if you were referring to that could change earlier in Europe. There was something new thank you. You know what? I mean? You're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, you know, we treat them that way obviously we've talked a lot about gcp but Jesus feet, you know continues to be very differentiated and you know, we just announced A new leader.

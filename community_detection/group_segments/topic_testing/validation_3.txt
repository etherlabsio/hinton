So what we found out very quickly was and this is it comes in motion talk to anybody in this room. But the more meeting have especially in person meeting the higher the upsell value the way more likely you're going and he built the comp plan. So, of course if you're going to have customer success manager is managing upsells or to come them a little bit more like salespeople. So what we did was we took everyone's bonus structure and instead of making that based on, you know, we Cut the piece that was going to based on renewals and Fern and business effective. So they had that piece and then they also had a commission fees so they could essentially earn as much money as they possibly could with that outsell. So portable. This was a quote actually promoting my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsell to you. So basically what we did was we putting in these meeting quotas. He said like the more you talk to your customers the more you are going to sell. I promise you. The better relationship you have the more money that's going to come in. They're going to want these people want to spend money with people a like if you will they talk to you all the time. Not just people who are helping them in a crisis. So I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun here and go a little bit to our results and then I'm gonna go back to why we can get work. So within one year of moving all the upselling and focusing on upsell within our group we decrease turn by 25% Upsell increase by two hundred and sixty-seven percent and one of the things people always ask me with this is you guys have more resources. We accurate answer is actually probably not because we have a lot more sales people that we have Christmas. That's right. So we actually probably decrease the amount of people who are working on these deals and up someone up by 267. ",

Well, since we're teaching the computer how to do it computer company, eyeball the line so as to get it to draw a random line, And then see how fast this thing is. So in order to see how bad the line is calculate the error. So we're going to protecting the error look at the length of the distances from the line to the three points and respond to Simply say the error of this line is the sum of those three read lengths. Now we're going to do is multiply around and see if we can reduce this error. So let's say we move in this direction. And we calculate the error given by the yellow distances. We add them up and realize that will increase the error. So that's not a good direction to go. Let's try moving the other direction over here calculate the error now, it's given by the sum of these three green distances. And we see that the error is smaller. So we actually reduced it. So let's say we take that step where a little closer to our solution. If we continue doing this procedure several times, we will always be decreasing the error until finally I got a right to a good solution in the form of this line is General procedure is known as gradient descent now in real life, we don't want to deal with negative distances corresponding to point being on one or the other side of the line. So we do to solve this is ad. Square of the distance from the point of the line step and this procedure is called the least squares. ",

Now the question is can we get computers to learn from experience to and the answer is yes, we can and that's precisely what machine learning is. Of course for computers past experiences have a name of data. So in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you a few examples in which we can teach the computer how to learn from previous data and most importantly I'm going to show you that these algorithms are actually pretty easy and the Machine learning is really nothing to fear.

Conveniently, there's a live demo runs in the browser with our census data pre-loaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person.

We don't have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions. I said the half size. So it's larger than the number of items in the vocabulary. Here's how this works under the hood. Normally a categorical feature is represented as a 100 coating. That means there's one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance. Now, if we don't know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically. The downside is that could be collisions mean different items are mapped to the same value. Crashes can also be used to limit memory usage at the cost of adding some noise to your training data. If you have a large vocabulary, it can be memory-intensive to use that as input to a neural network. ",

You can think of an embedding as a vector that represents the meaning of a word and we can visualize the data set word embeddings using the tensorflow embedding projector and there's an online demo you can find in the description here. We're looking at a data set of 10,000 words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to 3D so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you'll find similar words are often close together. For example, all of the words in this cluster cities what's neat about weddings is that they're learned automatically process of training a DNA and to make that happen. All you need to do is write that column here will create a wedding for Education 10 Dimensions. Now embeddings are helpful. If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts. Rather than memorizing the meaning of specific words, for example. Imagine if the Census Data had a column called job title. There are thousands of different jobs and an embedding could be used to help your classifier. Learn the words like programmer and software engineer often mean the same thing. ",

So what we decided was that our client base was actually our biggest opportunity as well as our biggest challenge. So like many of you I'm sure what happened with Bentley as we go and we sellable one small piece of information. So you take a company like Pepsi and we're working with Pepsi or not working with Gatorade and we're not working with Mountain Dew Amazon and all of the different subsidiaries or different business. So we decided at the beginning of 2014 was that we're going to try something. We were going to rewrite the rules between sales and customer success. And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and for everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it. Basically what we decided to do with that customer success. We're going to own all upsells how we defined an upsell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with own that entire parent company relationship. So if we close the Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and that we do and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that those to be like a massive opportunities that customer success was not only that relationship instead of sales.

So today I'm going to be talking about land and expand philosophy that we've embraced at Billy and I know this is sort of something that a lot of people talk about and sort of who owns upsell and cross-sell relationship to get larger that can sometimes become the tension between sales and success game. So we're going to talk about a little bit about how it is. Did it happen today? So real quick a little bit of background about me. So I'm the director of customer set that bit me. I we are based in New York. And have been that way for about two and a half years is to make something like this oldest employee of Italy at the moment. So I feel like I've been around the block a few times. So my team we've got about and got seven people on the team right now. We're hiring aggressively and then just a little bit about that lie so that Li you guys all probably know busy in some capacity of not go on Twitter and the person is palpable the Ability Link. I'm sure but we were establishing 2008 to solve like a very real problem on the web which was that link for too long the books. So pretty basic there when it's painted in about 60 employees three offices you want differences again with about 1,200 Enterprise clients. So the first question I always get when I say that I'm a director customers accessibility is how to Simply make money and what does it mean that you manage accounts up lately? A lot of people don't realize that we have an Enterprise product. We have about 1200 Enterprise customers. We've got 9 million freezes and both of those will let me to the customer success team which presenting challenges and of itself. We kind of the size and scale of Italy is also interesting. So we short about 600 million weeks and months see about eight to nine billion clicks and I'm about 2 billion aggressive Target. There's a little bit of background sort of understand the size and scale. So now I'm basically just going to take you guys through the story of like what we did Billy nothing. It's like the right model of the wrong model. Definitely a different model than most people and it can be a little bit controversial at times when I talk about this. So to take a step back as a beginning of 2013. ",

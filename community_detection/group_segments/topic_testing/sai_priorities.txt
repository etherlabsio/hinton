One of the things that we have to do here is also to promote user engagement is when the users installed right now, we just take them to the dashboard or the admin page. There's not a lot the admin can do one of the things that will be good to show is to list all the public channels that we have access to and at least select have the admin select a few channels from there to invite either so that way those, you know, then the engagement will start because each of these channels will get the ether invite message. It will show the selection of the mines and so on and so forth so bunch of things that we can do that will hopefully improve a little bit more on engagement. This is there's a page in The Ether meet ether labs are that we need to select channels to share some memories with this is required for the zoom because you will get the email with the somebody and then you'll have to click a button which will open the the labs app take you to the summary and you know, give a selection drop-down that you love to do. So this is a page that will have to design and went. Anyway, after all of these is done deep if you can start looking at the Android app, that will be great because right now we don't have an Android app at all because did she does not work on the Android web for real? Call Post colors? Okay, but you know, the real time called doesn't work on Android which I'm sure will start to hear about pretty soon. Then we can look at the improve Netflix experience. We talked about this already and then there is also on the platform side. There's a few things related to sending dip messages on install.

That thing called ether cost Collins architecture review President Obama and conversation with Etc. And you look at the number of communities one. It's of 81 minute call. So it's about an hour and 20 minutes. Yeah, one two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine ten, eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen important. Which is not which is okay. It's not that you know, there are in fact that many communities but I think it just it's just a little too much for slack right just in terms of what we are able to push back it will be great. If you can limit it to somewhere between five to seven. I think that's ideal. Let's also kind of look at these, you know to Deuce here. These are okay because it's a very I think these are these are really a really good to do is because these are from a part from a podcast or talk net somebody gave so which is which is pretty good.

Meeting with Shanks working on hopefully we got the we also need to you know, clean up the chronologically, you know sorted key phrases in summaries. That is something that we need to push. There's a brunch the front of bunch of front-end backlog items in addition to the ones that are required for Zoom integration. There is /cast posture assume cancel and start again, which we talked about earlier which we need to look at. We need to we need to look at the IOS app launch speed Improvement. So Nisha, I think you're working on this already.

The next one is to make sure that all the changes that we are making for jitsi, which is essentially removing the header and also trying to see if we can fix some of these shoes with the video which maybe which we're still not sure of what what is the root cause for that so one if you can take a look at make sure that today you work with Franklin to complete the testing of the of the new Gypsy in Aging and let's get that deployed to production. And then after that as a secondary task, we can start cooking at just focusing on the video called we know the video joining issue. It looks like a regression because it didn't happen before and also it looks like when in the in a similar scenario when you're on iOS you don't run into that issue. So some difference between iOS and web that's possibly causing it so we should probably look into that. But let's get the first round of the chase a related changes like you're moving the header Etc in there are a couple of other smaller things that we need to look into once we complete this and that has to do with the pop-up messages that you get saying that moderators are some moderator related messages that you get for every person was joining. For example, in ether meet joins. We get a message that says ether meet has been granted. Moderator permissions Etc. So that's something that we should probably check.

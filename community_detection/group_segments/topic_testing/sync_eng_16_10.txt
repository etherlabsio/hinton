Yeah, yes, I so we're like we discussed I discussed this money. We can make it zero to be minimum instead of like showing that negative value. So what you have to do is that by the time the quarter started someone was already speaking. So it started the transcription started at zero, but some for some reason that timestamp is coming to be less than from what the recording started at.And that's why I tell position was going wrong.

I was like working completely on that setting up.Apis Commander think I opened a couple of beers on the GitHub AI engine. So I have said the current scheme as well. So as and when when I'm like updating populating the data from staging to update the schema.So it's like a update schema then run queries and check each one.

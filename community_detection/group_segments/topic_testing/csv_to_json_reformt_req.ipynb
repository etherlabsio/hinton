Complex tasks so things like planning vacations of the insurance options with what we see is users continue to go back to desktop notwithstanding the growing utility of mobile. And I think one of the things that we've been very focused on is that innovations that benefit mobile also enhance the desktop experience for users and advertisers Amendment terms of you know, be asleep.

We have developed a very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search search quality, you know to get to the defense of such quality and how user satisfaction is through search but to give you a sense of you know, we continue no continue to take that work deeper really allows users sometimes, you know do searches through sessions understanding what is their satisfaction? \n",

You had called out how some car changes may cause you're over your girlfriend's to fluctuate from time to time and we haven't heard of a couple quarters. So as we look out towards like 2020 and Beyond you feel like a lot of the products here is in a good place as far as search and YouTube are concerned and that you know, these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future just make over there.

So in terms of the first question, you know, I think it's very I talked about we're pleased with the Strength of the business that you've seen here again in the third quarter as we said since the IPO, we don't manage the business to maximize quarterly results and will always do the right thing for the long term. We're very focused on investing for the long-term and tried to make it clear in opening comments that you know, as a result quarterly growth can bury and have buried and you know, I think to your question in our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you you've seen since the beginning of the year for us underscore the strengthen and the vibrancy actually in our business and that's particularly true at our size in the last 12 months. We've generated over a hundred fifty billion in total revenues.

I mean for us as well as I think source of competitive Advantage, you know, as as Moore's Law affect serve diminished, I think you know, we are looking at a variety of approaches to make sure we can continue doing what we need to do in that need is an important tool in the Arsenal while Quantum will take you know, many years to really start making a difference.

Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways. You can go and CP and just one follow-up with root you delivered it to some Gigi. Some G3 pricing changes and I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year and I was just curious if you were referring to that could change earlier in Europe. There was something new thank you. You know what? I mean? You're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, you know, we treat them that way obviously we've talked a lot about gcp but Jesus feet, you know continues to be very differentiated and you know, we just announced A new leader.

So I think in general given me have a bigger Market effort the breath you have allows us to have more conversations and engage too many different paths in the organization. So it's very synergistic as well. And in terms of the G sweet pricing it was referencing the pricing that we announced back in April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was it was the right time increase prices. Given that the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G sweet.

There's a focus for us and the efforts like early or definitely showing strong protection and then you asked about click growth in the trend there the thickest Drive Iver affecting the click Trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement as as in the the first and second quarter the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. It does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and Advertiser experience. And as we talked about a prior calls that did have an impact on click growth, but as we also talked about Out they weren't related to those changes in 2018 were not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube Revenue, so not a read-through. Thank you. Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today.

So Shri was looking into that and he said there is a small bug in the recent deployment that he did from the error perspective, but from the logic it's illogical book, so he's going to fix that today and And that s*** - or at least improve improve the way we are seeing the community based films. I mean it wouldn't be so off but still parallely. We are also discussing on how to how to take more control of the communities instead of relying on this, you know sensitive instead of making making it more or less sensitive. Actually So currently it's very sensitive to any any Community formation and other aspects so at a high level like a posted in the engineering Channel We are looking at ways to take take more control of the graph formation. And they and also the body called the Dead the relationship formation the graph Community formation. So it needs some experimentation. We are we are discussing on that and also parallel. We are what you call experimenting so we should have when we will keep you posted on this. But as of this is this what it is we have we have to address some of the The problems with the community formation for the wherein you know hierarchies are not really a currently hierarchies are not in our control. So it's like a blanket hierarchy for Direction. So we have to take control of that. That means we should be fuzzy about it. We shouldn't be doing like a blanket formation so which which is the problem that we have. I mean currently solving a tap from a more technical standpoint. \n",

That means we're trying to find out if they're to two places to optimize that action items. Right one is the model L2 at the post processing level. So the model we are just using the 50% conference threshold. I think that's fine for now the biggest One potential Improvement is that even your back? Right? So one potential Improvement is to find out the leakage is where in you you have you have confidence for a an action item? But it just got just got out because there is now there is the subject isn't really qualitative. So for that currently again again under that we have we are addressing only the sentences that are having self-contained subjects, right? So so if they're not if they are referring to prop up pronouns and we are just filtering out so that's one one candidate for improvement. So which which I think show em should be working on and then and then the other other one is there is there is a there is a The sentence is self-contained. But still we are we are not we are just filtering it out. So we just need to find out the Mist Outpost. I mean the post-processing steps that are causing this and then see how you can fix that. like so and on the model part, we haven't I don't think we need anything right now to I think the current model is suffice. It is giving enough false positives and true positive. So, so it's all about reducing the false positives and bye. \",\n",

Whereas as a new directly Feed The Entity and you get it. A decent enough representation this I double-checked by comparing giving an entity and taking the most similar entity. So this works well for the most part but in terms of actual sentence to sentence comparisons, it doesn't make that much of a difference whether we use the in incremental approach or this approach.

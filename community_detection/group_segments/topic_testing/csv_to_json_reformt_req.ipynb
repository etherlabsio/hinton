We have developed a very comprehensive metric for measuring and tracking search search quality, you know to get to the defense of such quality and how user satisfaction is through search but to give you a sense of you know, we continue no continue to take that work deeper really allows users sometimes, you know do searches through sessions understanding what is their satisfaction? \n",

You had called out how some car changes may cause you're over your girlfriend's to fluctuate from time to time and we haven't heard of a couple quarters. So as we look out towards like 2020 and Beyond you feel like a lot of the products here is in a good place as far as search and YouTube are concerned and that you know, these product changes might be a little bit more subtle going forward or could we return to having more meaningful impact in the future just make over there.

We're very focused on investing for the long-term and tried to make it clear in opening comments that you know, as a result quarterly growth can bury and have buried and you know, I think to your question in our view is that quarterly growth around the rates you you've seen since the beginning of the year for us underscore the strengthen and the vibrancy actually in our business and that's particularly true at our size in the last 12 months. We've generated over a hundred fifty billion in total revenues.

I mean for us as well as I think source of competitive Advantage, you know, as as Moore's Law affect serve diminished, I think you know, we are looking at a variety of approaches to make sure we can continue doing what we need to do in that need is an important tool in the Arsenal while Quantum will take you know, many years to really start making a difference.

Can you just walk through how you prioritize the two big buckets? There's a lot of different ways. You can go and CP and just one follow-up with root you delivered it to some Gigi. Some G3 pricing changes and I know there were some prices that were changed earlier in the year and I was just curious if you were referring to that could change earlier in Europe. There was something new thank you. You know what? I mean? You're right. I mean, these are two big buckets, you know, we treat them that way obviously we've talked a lot about gcp but Jesus feet, you know continues to be very differentiated and you know, we just announced A new leader.

So I think in general given me have a bigger Market effort the breath you have allows us to have more conversations and engage too many different paths in the organization. So it's very synergistic as well. And in terms of the G sweet pricing it was referencing the pricing that we announced back in April. It's all outlined in a blog post. Our view was it was the right time increase prices. Given that the ongoing functionality and tools that are included within G sweet.

There's a focus for us and the efforts like early or definitely showing strong protection and then you asked about click growth in the trend there the thickest Drive Iver affecting the click Trends continues to be the growth of YouTube engagement as as in the the first and second quarter the rate of YouTube click growth decelerated in the third quarter. It does continue to reflect the changes that we made in early 2018 to really improve the user and Advertiser experience. And as we talked about a prior calls that did have an impact on click growth, but as we also talked about Out they weren't related to those changes in 2018 were not related to policy enforcement actions that YouTube. They had a negligible impact on YouTube Revenue, so not a read-through. Thank you. Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today.

I meet at conferences where that people will say. I'm really excited about Docker because everybody keeps saying Dockers awesome, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it and I can't seem to find any resources online that help me actually get started with Docker and understand you know what it's actually good for. So we're going to kind of cover that we're going to start off with a high-level overview. What is Docker then we're going to show you with really quick. Just a few lines of code how you can deploy applications and then some kind of various thoughts on it along the way so let's get into it demystifying Docker. First thing we're going to do is we're going to compare Docker to vagrant or Docker to a virtual machine since this seems to be the hangout that I keep hearing from people. Okay, so I get vagrant but I don't get Docker. Well, that's because they're really different. Here's got a very visual people visual demonstration. What vagrant is I'm going to kind of show you real quickly vagrant for those you guys aren't familiar with it. And I'm going to show you how it's not really a fair comparison. So vagrant is the goal is to solve the problem of it works on my machine. It doesn't work on production or it works on my machine. It doesn't work on this other developers machine that happens because somewhere along the road you might be on a different operating system say your machine is a Mac or Windows machine and you're pushing it out to a Linux, you know server that alone could cause problems you might be running Wham form and on your It's a PHP application and these guys are actually running a full, you know, just native installation of an Apache stack or you have a different tool set that you're using then another developer. But any rate your environments are not the same so we solve that by spinning up a virtual machine in our computer. That's the exact same thing. We're going to be pushing to staging or production. So we'll use Virtual Willy's virtualbox and vagrant to spin up one saying a bunch of 1404 machine, which is \n",

So here that that is it's an empty machine and then you run your provisioning script against your virtual machine exactly as you would against a chair production. So the provisioning script will install the correct version of node.js or rails or PHP. It'll set up all the user permissions. It'll it'll stall any other software configure anything that needs to be configured. So at the end of the day, these are basically the same environment. So now I know that if I dump my project Coding to here and run it in this machine and it works. It's pretty much going to work when I push it out to GitHub and these servers pull it or I push it. However, you do your deployments when the code gets dumped into these it's going to run the same. So that's vagrant in a nutshell different boxes. We dumped our code into each box. Let's look at Docker and see why doctors actually different so for Docker, we got our machine. We've got our project code and Docker runs off of containers. So I use Docker file which is usually five to maybe 30 line fired file Docker files are really small the dockerfile bills once called the docker image that Docker image contains all my projects code it contains, you know saying installation of node.js has a node.js app, it contains any in installments of programs that I need. And so it's basically my complete application wrapped up in an image now, it's not a full say of bun to machine because I don't need that this image is designed to sit on top of a machine. So from that image, I can then run as many containers as I want until I run out of processing power in RAM on my machine. So this is the virtual machine on my Mac again, and I have my Docker image on the machine and I can run that Docker image and it runs as a container and I can run many many containers in the machine once again till I run out of stuff.

And now I can run that environment anywhere if a machine has Docker on it. My container is going to run and it's going to work. So then you push that Docker image up to say Docker Hub or queda I/O which are kind of like the GitHub Docker images and there's a bunch out there. You can have your own private Repository. Three the image goes out there that's like your GitHub repository so to speak and now any other machine can run your image. So let's say I call this image. My user name is will our Stern. Let's say I did will our Stern / mind, you know tap that's the name of it. So now on any computer I can say Docker run will our Stern / my new node at and this whole image source code and all will run with the complete environment. I didn't install node.js on this machine. I didn't provision this machine. Because the image has everything it has a complete environment all contained into one so I could run a node js image on this machine this container than has nodejs installed has anything else installed and p.m. And I can also run a rails app on the same machine rails is installed on that container but rails is not installed in this container. So they act like virtual machines, but the really self-contained processes so to speak let me go To show you an image here that I found somewhere online. I have no idea what this puppy dog is about but this is basically the anatomy of a Docker container. So this is your actual web server. You've got your web server yet the host operating system, which is a bun two or even something lighter and it has Docker installed. That's all you need. Docker is installed and then all the apps run as Docker containers and they all sit on top of your host operating system. \n",

Here's what that looks like. I've got this big cloud cluster of say 10 computers. They're all running either core offs or mezzos. These are kind of some of the big players. Hours, basically with these two operating systems do is they allow all the computers to act as one they share all their resources. And so now all you have to do is spin up containers and they all run within your cluster and then if you start running out of overall cluster memory for overall cluster Computing, you just add more nodes. So let's say okay. I'm just going to add 10 more computers to this cluster and now I can run 30 more containers so you can just say Let's once again, let's say this image is called my note app. I can run my note app for times boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Then I can spin up an nginx container and have it load balance these four and then expose a private portal to the real world. So then the real world can access my app. This is our doctor Works. Its really awesome for cloud computing really awesome for cluster Computing and that's where it really really starts to shine. But actually I think Docker is one of my favorite uses of docker. Docker is to just provision a single machine and deploy with no provisioning at all. It just spin up a machine make sure doctors installed and then you can run your containers on it. So that's kind of your brief overview. If you're not a visual person.

This is just one of the several applications of neural networks neural networks from the pace of people earning a subfield a machine learning where the algorithms are inspired by the structure of the human brain neural networks take in data train themselves to recognize the patterns in the data and then predict the outputs where a new set of similar data. Let's understand how this is done. Let's construct a neural network that differentiates between a square circle and triangle neural networks are made up of layers of neurons. These neurons are the core processing units of the network first. We have the input layer which receives the input the output layer predicts our final output in between exists a hidden layers, which perform most of the As required by our Network, here's an image of a circle. This image is composed of 28 by 28 x cells which make up for 784 pixels. Each pixel is fed as input to each neuron of the first layer neurons have one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer through channels. Each of these channels is assigned a numerical value known as wait the inputs are multiplied to the corresponding weights and their sum is sent. as input to the neurons in the hidden layer, each of these neurons is associated with a numerical value called the bias, which is then added to the inputs of this value is then passed through a threshold function called the activation function the result of the activation function determines if the particular neuron will get activated or not and activate a neuron transmits data do the neurons of the next layer over the channels in \n",

This is called forward propagation in the output layer the neuron with the highest value fires in determines the output the values are basically a probability. For example, here are neurons associated with square at the highest probability. Hence. That's the output predicted by the neural network. Of course just by a look at it. We know our neural network has made a wrong prediction, but top of the The Network's figured this out note that our network is yet to be trained during this training process along with the input. Our Network also has the output fed to it. The predicted output is compared against the actual output to realize the error in prediction the magnitude of the error indicates how wrong we are in the sign suggestive of our predicted values are higher or lower than expected the arrows here given indication of the direction and magnitude of change too. Use the error this information is then transferred backward through our Network. This is known as backpropagation now based on this information. The weights are adjusted this cycle of forward propagation and back propagation is iteratively performed with multiple inputs this process continues until our weights are assigned such that the network can predict the shapes correctly in most of the cases this brings our training process to an and you might wonder how long this training process takes honestly neural networks may take hours or even months to train but time is a reasonable trade off when compared to its scope. Let us look at some of the crime applications of neural networks facial recognition cameras on smartphones. These days can estimate the age of the person based on their facial features.

There are several problems with this method. First of all, the planning must be completed before any work begins and in most cases the planning is done without entirely understanding the project once development is being done often times things get sent back to the planning phase and the project either means to start over or the developers are has criticized for not understanding the plan. This cycle can happen many times. What development is done building the product gets thrown over the fence of tests where when problems are encountered. It bounces back to development and sometimes back to planning the same issues occur in the next few steps with lots of back stepping and doing over this can lead to length times and many months to several years in order to get a product out the door with scrum and implementation of agile. The process is broken. The smaller pieces first when you just not planning to get started with building the minimum feature set. We build what was planned next we test and review that small feature set and get it ready to ship. When that cycle is complete we end up with a potentially shippable product. This process usually occurs in a time period of one to three weeks. This is then repeated time and time again reducing the time from planning to development to testing each time through the planning process. We're doing just enough planning to complete the next incremental release you end up with several incremental releases called Springs a Sprint usually takes from one to three weeks and you just keep repeating these Sprint's until your product is feature complete. \n",

I meet at conferences where that people will say. I'm really excited about Docker because everybody keeps saying Dockers awesome, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it and I can't seem to find any resources online that help me actually get started with Docker and understand you know what it's actually good for. So we're going to kind of cover that we're going to start off with a high-level overview. What is Docker then we're going to show you with really quick. Just a few lines of code how you can deploy applications and then some kind of various thoughts on it along the way so let's get into it demystifying Docker. First thing we're going to do is we're going to compare Docker to vagrant or Docker to a virtual machine since this seems to be the hangout that I keep hearing from people. Okay, so I get vagrant but I don't get Docker. Well, that's because they're really different. Here's got a very visual people visual demonstration. What vagrant is I'm going to kind of show you real quickly vagrant for those you guys aren't familiar with it. And I'm going to show you how it's not really a fair comparison. So vagrant is the goal is to solve the problem of it works on my machine. It doesn't work on production or it works on my machine. It doesn't work on this other developers machine that happens because somewhere along the road you might be on a different operating system say your machine is a Mac or Windows machine and you're pushing it out to a Linux, you know server that alone could cause problems you might be running Wham form and on your It's a PHP application and these guys are actually running a full, you know, just native installation of an Apache stack or you have a different tool set that you're using then another developer. But any rate your environments are not the same so we solve that by spinning up a virtual machine in our computer. That's the exact same thing. We're going to be pushing to staging or production. So we'll use Virtual Willy's virtualbox and vagrant to spin up one saying a bunch of 1404 machine, which is \",\n",

Database management system or dbms is a collection of programs which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details. Your electricity service provider is obviously using a dbms to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data Etc. Let's consider the Facebook.

Hours, basically with these two operating systems do is they allow all the computers to act as one they share all their resources.

Boom. Boom. Boom. Then I can spin up an nginx container and have it load balance these four and then expose a private portal to the real world. So then the real world can access my app. This is our doctor Works. Its really awesome for cloud computing really awesome for cluster Computing and that's where it really really starts to shine. But actually I think Docker is one of my favorite uses of docker. Docker is to just provision a single machine and deploy with no provisioning at all.

We build what was planned next we test and review that small feature set and get it ready to ship. When that cycle is complete we end up with a potentially shippable product. This process usually occurs in a time period of one to three weeks. This is then repeated time and time again reducing the time from planning to development to testing each time through the planning process. We're doing just enough planning to complete the next incremental release you end up with several incremental releases called Springs a Sprint usually takes from one to three weeks and you just keep repeating these Sprint's until your product is feature complete. \",\n",

This is called forward propagation in the output layer the neuron with the highest value fires in determines the output the values are basically a probability. For example, here are neurons associated with square at the highest probability. Hence. That's the output predicted by the neural network. Of course just by a look at it. We know our neural network has made a wrong prediction, but top of the The Network's figured this out note that our network is yet to be trained during this training process along with the input. Our Network also has the output fed to it. The predicted output is compared against the actual output to realize the error in prediction the magnitude of the error indicates how wrong we are in the sign suggestive of our predicted values are higher or lower than expected the arrows here given indication of the direction and magnitude of change too. Use the error this information is then transferred backward through our Network. This is known as backpropagation now based on this information. The weights are adjusted this cycle of forward propagation and back propagation is iteratively performed with multiple inputs this process continues until our weights are assigned such that the network can predict the shapes correctly in most of the cases this brings our training process to an and you might wonder how long this training process takes honestly neural networks may take hours or even months to train but time is a reasonable trade off when compared to its scope. Let us look at some of the crime applications of neural networks facial recognition cameras on smartphones. These days can estimate the age of the person based on their facial features. This is neural networks that play first differentiating the base from the background and then correlating. \",\n",

We did not have any trouble and figuring our way out all things to Google's real-time translation of Russian boards into English. This is just one of the several applications of neural networks neural networks from the pace of people earning a subfield a machine learning where the algorithms are inspired by the structure of the human brain neural networks take in data train themselves to recognize the patterns in the data and then predict the outputs where a new set of similar data. Let's understand how this is done. Let's construct a neural network that differentiates between a square circle and triangle neural networks are made up of layers of neurons. These neurons are the core processing units of the network first. We have the input layer which receives the input the output layer predicts our final output in between exists a hidden layers, which perform most of the As required by our Network, here's an image of a circle. This image is composed of 28 by 28 x cells which make up for 784 pixels. Each pixel is fed as input to each neuron of the first layer neurons have one layer are connected to neurons of the next layer through channels. Each of these channels is assigned a numerical value known as wait the inputs are multiplied to the corresponding weights and their sum is sent. as input to the neurons in the hidden layer, each of these neurons is associated with a numerical value called the bias, which is then added to the inputs of this value is then passed through a threshold function called the activation function the result of the activation function determines if the particular neuron will get activated or not and activate a neuron transmits data do the neurons of the next layer over the channels in \",\n",

And now I can run that environment anywhere if a machine has Docker on it. My container is going to run and it's going to work. So then you push that Docker image up to say Docker Hub or queda I/O which are kind of like the GitHub Docker images and there's a bunch out there. You can have your own private Repository. Three the image goes out there that's like your GitHub repository so to speak and now any other machine can run your image. So let's say I call this image. My user name is will our Stern. Let's say I did will our Stern / mind, you know tap that's the name of it. So now on any computer I can say Docker run will our Stern / my new node at and this whole image source code and all will run with the complete environment. I didn't install node.js on this machine. I didn't provision this machine. Because the image has everything it has a complete environment all contained into one so I could run a node js image on this machine this container than has nodejs installed has anything else installed and p.m. And I can also run a rails app on the same machine rails is installed on that container but rails is not installed in this container. So they act like virtual machines, but the really self-contained processes so to speak let me go To show you an image here that I found somewhere online. I have no idea what this puppy dog is about but this is basically the anatomy of a Docker container. So this is your actual web server. You've got your web server yet the host operating system, which is a bun two or even something lighter and it has Docker installed. That's all you need. Docker is installed and then all the apps run as Docker containers and they all sit on top of your host operating system. \",\n",

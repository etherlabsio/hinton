How does that work asking those questions really helps you identify who's going to be key to making the decision so that you can engage those people make sure you have the right relationships in place to get the season that you want. One final tip that I always say to my clients as well. Don't be in a position to say to someone but you the decision maker because people will invariably say yes because they feel like they want to know if you feel that it could be someone else involved to Satan apart from yourself. Is anyone else involved in making this decision which then enables them to go to show they're important but also involve other people if they do have to go up through a hierarchy build again the decision focus on Authority. Who's going to make the decision around the project to service that you offer and try to understand what's key for them in making that decision do that and I can assure you it's going to give you a massive help when it comes to then remove your project from in a potential into a reality third aspect.

For example, a camera lens manufacturer may say that we have a camera lens of industry-leading f 1.2 aperture also the times these are technical in nature and do not directly connect with the customer. Not many customer may be able to decipher. What does it mean?

But basically what we decided to do was that customer success was going to own all of sales and how we defined it up sell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with on that entire parent company relationship. So if we close Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and Mountain Dew and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that.

Lambda is a compute service that runs your back-end code in response to events such as object uploads to Amazon S3 buckets updates to Amazon dynamodb tables data and Amazon Kinesis streams, or An app activity once you upload your code to Lambda the service handles all the capacity scaling patching and administration of the infrastructure to run your code and provides visibility into performance by publishing real-time metrics and logs to Amazon cloudwatch. All you need to do is write the code AWS. Lambda is very low cost and does not require any upfront investment when you use AWS Lambda You're simply charged a low fee per request and for the time Your code runs measured in increments of 100 milliseconds. Getting started with AWS. Lambda is easy. There are no new languages tools or Frameworks to learn you can use any third-party Library even native ones. The code you run on AWS. Lambda is called a Lambda function you just upload your code as a zip file or design it in the integrated development environment and the AWS Management console, or you can select from a list of functions samples pre-built for common use cases such as image conversion by Depression and change notifications and built-in support for the AWS SDK makes it easy to call other AWS Services. Once your function is loaded you select the Event Source to monitor such as an Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon dynamodb table and within a few seconds. Lambda will be ready to trigger your function automatically when an event occurs with Lambda any event. \", \"transcriptId\": \"f501cad3-7153-40c0-8450-5fb6be28b00e\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"6d501c7921d14c388d4581ab16dd36d7\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-19T11:25:40Z\", \"duration\": 28, \"spokenBy\": \"60d2ea6bed8c48269c8c024202a4148d\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-19T11:25:40.828958029Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-19T11:25:12Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-19T11:26:02.498330484Z\", \"confidence\": 0.77183294, \"recordingId\": \"2929e3dcb97b4974b846171227ae361a\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"Object-oriented relational dbms this type support storage new data types the data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database and attributes for example gender age and messes that Define what to do with the data postgresql is an example of object-oriented relational dbms.

Not only that Docker uses less dish space to as it is able to reuse files efficiently by using a layered file system. If you have multiple Docker images using the same base image for instance Docker only keep a single copy of the files needed and share them with each container. All right. So, how do we use Docker install Docker on your machine and will provide links in the description? In with a Docker file can be built into a Docker image which can be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The dockerfile is a surprisingly Simple Text document that instructs how the docker image will be built like a blueprint you first select a base image to start with using the from keyword which you can find a container to use from the docker Hub. Like we mentioned before a bunch of you in Alpine Linux are popular choices from there. You can run commands such as downloading installing and running your software of course will link the docks below blister Docker file is complete. Can build it using Docker build followed by the T flag so we can name our image and pass our commands the location of the dockerfile once complete. You can verify your images existence with Docker images. Now, you're built image can run a container of that image where you can push it to the cloud to share with others speaking of sharing with others. If you don't create your own Docker image and you just want to use a premade one in Poland from the docker hub using Docker bolt and the image name. You may also include a tag if one is available which may specify a version or variant of the software if you don't specify a tag the The latest version will be what's attached to run a container pulled down from a Docker Hub rebuild the image and then enter Docker run followed by the image name. There are of course many options available when running your containers such as running it is detached mode contact D or assigning ports for web services. You can view your running containers with Docker container LS. And as you add more they'll appear here putting a single container is fun, but it's annoying to enter all of these commands to get a container running and we may want to control several containers as part of a single application such as running an app and a database together something you might want to do. \", \"transcriptId\": \"f501cad3-7153-40c0-8450-5fb6be28b00e\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"1be9b109346a4d0bbeac7bbbbdb6bc6c\", \"status\": \"no_transcription\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-19T11:40:48Z\", \"duration\": 2, \"spokenBy\": \"60d2ea6bed8c48269c8c024202a4148d\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-19T11:40:48.517743724Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-19T11:40:46Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-19T11:41:09.362963466Z\", \"confidence\": 0, \"recordingId\": \"8f64ad684c9e454d84631705238f1c83\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"\", \"transcriptId\": \"f501cad3-7153-40c0-8450-5fb6be28b00e\", \"isEndOfSentence\": false}, {\"id\": \"a8e03495006443e68e4a48cc10da6ff7\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-19T11:18:49Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"60d2ea6bed8c48269c8c024202a4148d\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-19T11:18:50.907009098Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-19T11:16:49Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-19T11:19:52.478123845Z\", \"confidence\": 0.858471885, \"recordingId\": \"dc903cd4177c430ca88fb5df0789bb8c\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"To run WordPress for example, and we're going to be accomplishing that with Docker compose in our next video where we build a 23 terabyte Home Server.

Now if you think about how age correlates with income, our first intuition is that is Agent creases usually sodas, India. And the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here. We're building a list of features. We used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature column this contains data about the column from the CSV file and how to represent it here. We'll write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this strain corresponds to a column in the CSV file. Now what can go wrong with this approach.

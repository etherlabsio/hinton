So any time you're trying to retrieve data from a database, add data to a database or make any modifications to the data structures, you're probably going to be using some variant of the sequel for SQL Language. Let's get into the first reason why I believe you should learn sequel First, you can earn some great money, your next potential for somebody with strong sequel skills. It's pretty significant if you're a financial a**lyst or anybody who's XL Guru but lacks the sequel. Knowledge Learning Sequel might be the next step for you to really progress your career and identify an opportunity for a high earning job around with. The high earning potential sequels are the most sought after skills by employers that are hiring. This makes sense, given the emphasis on a**lytics in the growth of data, so it wouldn't apply that employers are looking for a warrant for individuals with the talent to retrieve data from a database using sequel and know what to do with him and run with the career oriented reasons for learning Sequel never means that you might want to learn secrets because it enables you to get an answer to any question that you asked. If you're an inquisitive person and want to know as much as possible about your business sequel enables you to think of those questions and then get an answer to those questions without having to go to a bunch of different people trying to find answers.

So if you're somebody dressed to deal with Excel, crashing frequently because of the volume or types of operations you try to do with data sequel is going to enable you to overcome that obstacle and be more efficient. The last reason we're gonna talk about as to why you should learn sequel is that it enables you to never have to ask yourself a question like How did I make that report again? Secret queries could be saved and easily rerun at any point in time. So if there's something that has many steps to record is a little bit more complicated instead of having to re do all your work, you can see that clearly when you need to run it again, you just simply open it up and executed. While there are certainly some things that you could do with it, except to be more efficient with your report, automate certain things through V. P. A. Or power pivot or something like that, Secret is going to make that process much, much easier. So I get Sequel is going to enable you to be incredibly efficient and not waste any time by redoing manual processes that could simply be opened up from your safe Really executed. And while you have the results so wrap it up, you should learn in secret because of a higher earning potential. It's one of the most in demand skills. It empowers you to answer your own questions of your data. You will really have to deal with Excel crashing if you write your queries and sequel against a database, and you won't have to redo nearly as much manual effort because you can save your queries usually open and then you run them at any time.

This would require them to change their mind set on half dead and ops work. So what is Devils? Dev-ops integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure. Automating work flows on by continuously measuring application performance. If Anna and Dave's teams were more dev-ops for it, they would do a few things differently. They would place more focus on automation. Dev-ops teams try to automate everything from testing a new code to how infrastructure is provisions. They would write software and small chunks that are integrated tested, monitored and deploy usually an hour's, versus a traditional way of writing large chunks of software over weeks or months and then do weeks or months of testing. Plus, they will have identical development and production environments based on the same configurations. Writing small chunks of code will allow them to increase the frequency of deployments and improve the time to deploy new coat. It also enables them to adopt a generative process to monitor, measured and improve the coat and operations every day, improved their ability to respond to market needs or other things that impact software instead of building and configuring software.",

Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices.

But if they don't have automate another email that sends a week later that says, Hey, I know you've been busy We really would love this feedback. Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.",

And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad.

And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

You could start building your list of skilled labor to say if you ever wanted the delivery service is or whatever service is last minute, I need people. Here's how much approximately gonna make from it. Give me your phone number and I'll text you any time I get a job. That's how you start when you build your list and you ask them for friends and you, you start small. You're testing it to see if it works.

For example, if some of our data are missing features, so meaning we couldn't observe that features value, then unsupervised learning models can be used to fill in these missing values in a process called imputation. Similarly unsupervised model information could be used. His features either to augment the original features will replace them with our simplified explanation of data.",

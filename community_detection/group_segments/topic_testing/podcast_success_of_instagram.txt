I remember where we were like. Alright. Well, maybe we should be doing more of this. We spent some time pretending Hardware ideas that never saw the like the day and that oh, they are heart was in it for either of them and then the end result of all that iteration was saying I got to solve a problem we have today which is people want to post longer video on Instagram doesn't really fit in Peters variety TV came out of but I think we eventually got to the point where we got the team to trust us and saying that the jobs are the thing that carry forward three years my erection problem solving that job that you're doing at now plus some adjacent ones. I'm like technology we will continuously be looking at and saying alright that now being taken mainstream that is now available on the iPhone 4 to bring it to everybody. Not so much wrong wearing a our headsets. Let's build that today because he's going to use it. And by the way, you have a billion people that would have benefited from a different thing. You could have been building on instead. I don't think enough teams think about the opportunity cost of being super pie in the sky and obviously it's important to have already teams and some companies develop that technology else it wouldn't exist. But I think folks often confused very product heavy companies for very Hardy driven companies and lose sight of solving problems that can be solved today.

Mike's kind of annoyed that this Borg is not exactly struck with the right way. Yeah, I'll keep raising it but I'm really excited to get to tell this to listen to you guys. Just two major things that I extract and I'm just curious if you think these to explain things best. The first is this sort of community / product centricity which for other great lot of Business Leaders talked a lot about this principle Bezos. Most notably maybe with this kind of customer Obsession idea, and then the What's really interesting is this humility tied to pragmatic observation that you're not trying to predict what the problems are going to be five years from now trying to look around and see what they are today. And the humility piece is the willingness to disrupt your own business. You think of those are kind of the right two pillars of my missing a major one. I totally forgot we had this principle or early on or we call it a value which is humble but confident it's like you should be ripping confident about your idea, but humble enough to know you might be wrong figure it out. Pretty quickly. I don't know why we focus so much on that humility. I think it was just because the fear of being wrong the fear of missing this great opportunity. I mean, let's go back to this context. We were two guys who pretty good jobs and Tack and we both really desperately wanted to try to take a crack at starting a start-up and this was our one chance if this didn't go well, I mean probably not going to raise money again anytime soon. We just do those guys and burned that cash and this was our chance. I think the only way you face challenges like that is to say we are going to put everything possible and making sure these people who use a product or happy and that we're going to try to be so humble that every moment we're going to maybe question ourselves four times before cutting or before shooting or whatever you want. And when we do that that just raises the chances of success at every single trial play do it. \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"0881d323e38541c999da18e28d584557\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:37:59Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T13:38:00.579523426Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:35:59Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T13:39:02.349512679Z\", \"confidence\": 0.7948095040000001, \"recordingId\": \"e32b466ad260476bac65bb2d7365f19b\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"Public but it's so portable and can travel with it and generate useful Insight is a combination of I'm pretty excited about you guys have an unusual maybe singular experience of being kind of the prototypical early-stage garage style Founders from bootstrapping something interesting like Instagram for managing a very big team also doing inside of one of the largest companies in the world. There's just got to be really interesting insight to tap from her guy's brains because of this experience. So the first is the ways in which your thoughts on leadership and management Of teams and people may be changed the most or vulva most in the time in which you were at Facebook. I don't know how big the team was when you joined, I guess 12 and the Thousand when you left so what major chunky lessons you take from the leadership part. Job on Facebook. So there were how many chapters well lay out the chapters and then we'll go through them. First is the me and my face it was just us we were hacking we're getting stuff done. I mean the big thing I think we realized there was enormous privatization of your time working on things that matter soap again identifying problems that people actually have rank ordering with your actually focused on and focusing only on the top one or two things to the detriment of everything else and it's okay. We had a no external meeting policy. For like four months before launch and it drove investors crazy. It's like what do you mean don't you guys think you are he was not borne out of arrogance is literally born of the fact that there were two of us and every minute spent outside. Our tiny desk on a pier was minutes of the product wasn't getting billed and we stuck to it basically until we launched but also some like remember or two of us so scale and leverage it was an enormous lesson that we entered into this death spiral where we launched. I think we might have been That we were two people aren't we launched? And I think we hired Josh our community manager right after that and then we got changed to come on and so it was for people but the problem was it was growing like a weed and we were fixing it and not hiring people. So we went into this death spiral of not having enough time to hire people. \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"82eead2edd1c4abd84b2d438e4311c3c\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T14:03:59Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T14:04:00.424943784Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T14:01:59Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T14:05:01.962193043Z\", \"confidence\": 0.803572825, \"recordingId\": \"9252ce1a1fd14dae82c2ff552ed4a0dd\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"With was you should always have a list of things that you think are really interesting but you don't quite have the time to do right now and I have a long list of those and it keeps crying but when I left Instagram and said to myself, okay, what do I want to do when I was like, well, you know go Venture investing in people hiking. I did the skiing thing we talked about I looked down at my list. I said, oh that's right. I have this list and I went through it. I was like, I think people who sometimes leave their companies get a little I don't know the word might be Don't they just get a little slow? They're not as sharp as they're not managing something every day. It's like I want something really hard to learn or my life's on the line and the could be like thrilling and exciting but also very technical. So I was like, okay I could either do my trip to Japan isn't those things or I could learn to fly. So I looked up a local school asked them to learn to fly. I went up and I was like, okay, this is definitely going to be the thing that keeps me sharp. And by the way, I went through my regular license and I got my instrument readings. The course of about six months of training pretty quick, but I had a lot of time and by the end I was like, that's exactly what I needed. It was both a distraction from the tech world just to get my head for you a little bit but also an expansive view of what the human brain can do. If you just give it a little bit of time that's why I learned to fly but it had a lot of what else is on the sometimes maybe was the someday maybe someday the yeah, I can't stay only one items come off to we talked about first rule of someday, Maybe.

You just don't have time for a lot of these other big projects. It's a list of things. I want to learn to do with the list of places. I want to travel if Mike goes to a cool hotel somewhere and try some great drink or something. I'll put it down. So it's a mix of different levels. Some of them are a little bit cooler than others.

Good experiment. This connection fee of a real pleasurable intentional experience. That was Blue Bottle my other purse locations and that's sort of when I think it was actually a fun instance of crap that Instagram early on which has we got everybody's account was a barista and college understands espresso really well and we taught basically every new employee how to pull a reasonable espresso shots yet. Any given moment. You see somebody over there priming intending it down. Extracting and wandering back to their desk. I was like a good sort of onboarding experience that we both enjoyed. I think the key here to understanding the story is that I didn't want anyone touching the espresso machine that wasn't trained. I mean, I'm like fairly detail-oriented. So Mike's a overbearingly detail-oriented but the idea that like a new employee was going to come on and touch this espresso machine will get it all dirty. I was mortified so it's true actually and I don't know if you know this but one of our early employees Shane I was talking to him the other day you open up a coffee shop. Did he really? Yeah. Oh, yeah exactly. I mean, it's not the only thing but my point is it's traveled far and wide and the Instagram Community but early on I was just like country going to stay awake really afford to go to the coffee shop all the time. So I was like, if you can have a really nice espresso. You can even have a sink nearby it was a terrible idea. What is the key to pulling a good shot? If I were to give one answer, it's measurements absolutely all measurements. If you don't have exactly how many grams of being you're going to grind in.

I think that was all left to be figure it out. But I think we both always had the intuition once we were answered. And other program that this thing is monetizable if it's large enough, we'd be idiots not to be able to monetize it in some way. I do remember our pitch to Benchmark Capital who that was our Series be there is a series a you're right. So we had our seed all right. Yeah and for K so and if I can go back and re pitch I would try so much harder. I think we walked in with maybe three slots may be a user growth saw a dime business model question mark slide, but I remember the business mark question model slide, which featured We have two screenshots and I remember that a picture of Banana Republic and I had a photo and it was an ad by Banana Republic effectively and we didn't have at that time. And I don't think we had Banana Republic at that time, but we got to a point where they did sign up and that didn't come true and I'm pretty sure they advertise on Instagram now. So those are series a I mean we understood that you could have ads on Instagram. I think our pitch was listen, what are the most effective ads in the world today? We're just people spend all their money. It's cringe and video advertising. On TV magazines Etc. It's not that different. This is just on your phone. Yeah, and then it's all been figured it out over time and at the beginning it was highly manual. We thought of looking at every a - my favorite do the simple thing first stories that we ever had. So the first add product by on Instagram. It was a pretty big deal. You need to be the only advertisements from that.

It's fascinating to think about the ways in which Instagram has shaped culture like letter H square-shaped things that show out the people can take pictures in front of how much did you think or care about that specific outcomes, like a medium is the message kind of thing. We didn't care not that we didn't care about the outcome. Obviously we cared about Come but I don't put it there was a great Venture investor here in town that we met with the other week and he said often the companies that basically start off searching for great startup idea. Never find one the companies that start off with. Hey, I had this Edge I wanted to scratch it. I think other people have this problem too. I'm going to create something really awesome that like solves this thing for me and to be very clear. The first version of Instagram was literally for me it like it was Is all the stuff we wanted in a product bourbon, right? But the future version of bourbon that would become Instagram when we decide to just do photos only we focused solely on what we thought was an awesome product for us. And thankfully that resonated with a larger group spur photos came.

And I feel like I was great except for this one thing or it's a Stern. Okay. Well, we need to hit the reset button and do something different just a lot of intentionality around that practice of poor management was Key, and I think that's how we got from 16 people with no managers to this get your later. We were almost 80 and we already had probably 12 managers managing that you sort of start figure out the right ratios that you wanted. So you make a great when we grew up in a very interesting way where our first managers other than Kevin happened. Once we were already inside Facebook, which meant that we were able to sort of look at what was working. Well about their internal screw or Engineering Management discipline and say great that works really? Well. Let's adopt that as much as possible. I think one of the Is that maybe we both caught on towards the end with don't forget that your main job is to build great products for people you can get into the state where you've got career letters. You've got all these tools for managing at scale. When is the last time you sat down and said what product are you going to build for people? What do they care about or are you just sitting there having people bring it to you to the don't actually subscribe to the same philosophy is that we did early on and and I think it's really important to remember. That the job. Yes, you need to scale but the job is not to just manage people the job is to fill great stuff and if managing people is in the name of that and awesome. So Mike and I would try to spend a tremendous amount of time. Just bring people back to that core problem.

So you have to have the self-awareness to know that you don't know everything hire people that can teach you or get yourself unless and otherwise but also them sort of open-mindedness saying I don't know that yet but not knowing that is standing in the way of me proving something out or solving some problem. And then taking that as for learning mentality like that was us over and over and over and over again. I think I have to collect this one is no matter what new idea you have people are going to tell you it's thanks people are going to tell you it's not possible. It's been done a bunch of times. I mean think about how many times when we said we were doing photo sharing your like photo sharing has been done. When's the last time anyone innovated in photos? They're going to tell you this and the goal is twofold one is First of all, if you're looking for some sense of congratulations or go get em, you're not going to get it yours is not the second is that doesn't mean it's a terrible idea. It also doesn't mean it's a good idea. The one common thing of all great ideas is that they usually look pretty bad at the beginning also really bad idea is also one bad at the game.

We isolated the things that were working and then out came Instagram, but everyone along the way I even the first couple of years people were saying and strands of that.

Seeing how much data has become an essay like a first class citizen in programming what I mean by that is I remember when we were first being up even some Instagram data pipelines go a bunch of ad hoc scripts they run every night. Hopefully, sometimes they fail we can tell the story of our first analytics pipeline ranks seriously duct tape harrowing disaster and going from that to the point where you have things like tensorflow be readily available. I've been playing with some data pipeline stuff where it's just much more. Much more thoughts through much more built for a whole team working together on data rather than that one get Alice in the corner. That's probably the thing that was most changed from when we started Instagram where the new hotness then was web Frameworks. Let you spin up a site fairly quickly like Django and rails to know I think the same opportunities this data pipelines. I feel like when we started we were beginners and by the end we went mastered the game. You can never quite mastered the game, but by the end we had figured out our game and we had A great run and we created something that a lot of people love in the world over a billion people use up your month. We were really proud of the team. We had created it was over a thousand people when we left across how many offices three main ones and probably six or seven other ones. Yeah, exactly. So we had all these amazing people around the world and to be 35 and I guess Mike is 33 pressing the reset button and starting again.

That is I think we've seen this probably like I don't think people get enough credit as consumers for kind of sniffing out the intentions or sort of the underlying ethos of the companies that they're using. I think they're getting even more attuned to it now so they can same Community First would be a first for us was alternate people can tell who they're kind of using products from they can tell what the ethos is and I think people really couldn't tell for a long time has been kept running Instagram and whether that meant we would post announcements to the explore Page 6 of the only way we could Came with people about outages that we were going to do or risk going to make or seeing us on public we're doing talks and I think it kind of cuts through so the truth and I need Community First is people can tell his behind the company.

You have to just kind of see what people say they want to time what problem it solves at the time knowing that those problems get Barbed away pretty quickly and then it's on to the next thing but imagine Instagram today has live streaming. There's not a world in which I thought live streaming could happen on Instagram. You want just sell speed was so slow the devices were so so I don't even think When we did it become possible to like take a video on the iPhone. I mean, maybe it was always possible but I don't think you could share it. I don't even remember and use the iPhone 4S or just jumps on my right. We should go back to the books to figure this out. But the idea that video was going to exist and that you can stream it and if someone could go live and stream it to the world.

Now, how do we solve it best and then that'll burn us the ticket to go solve the next version and the next version the next version if you amass a community in the meantime, and you're nice to them, they will pay you back and then some and that's how Instagram got to where it is today. That should get to the management challenge. I think we had over time which was I think we share this characteristic Kevin are very complementary in many ways.

I don't even remember how we got out of it. But the point is hiring people earlier for something that's working. I think it was both enormously awfully small and Nimble when we had to be but then when that thing starts going don't hesitate to hire. I mean Mike did a lot of the early hiring early on but also did a tremendous amount of the server fixing at 1 a.m. There are pictures of him on a camping trip where he's got his laptop open with a Wi-Fi card rebooting the servers but scale and leverage. I think at that point was important. What about maybe once we joined vigil? Yeah, I think what was interesting about that transition is we were I think at that time 16, we hired all over for people during the time of the deal closed and we needed to accelerate and one of the benefits of being inside face because they put a ton of work and serve core Engineering Management training. So I think a lot of companies sort of look around and say That person has been around the longest maybe they should manage and the often the wrong approach. So I think the two things from there that we adopted an aggressively the right thing. Number one is make management a parallel career track to individual contribution and it sounds obvious and I would just assume that most companies do this because just speaking at a dinner for growth stage companies and I was sort of talking about this point if you like, of course everybody does this so it came out to me after I was like, I was about to roll out our new career ladders and they don't do that in management was a promotion. I'm so glad I came. This dinner tonight, but it's essential because you don't want people to self-select management just because if they see it as a promotion or the way that they're going to get more Authority in the company, but as a calling or at least interested like the now I'm more interested in the people signed building out the teams and that's something we adopted very early and we actually let people transition from one to the other one case one person went into management 2002 years was excited to get his hands dirty again. Did that brother? You're the back into management so it can be fairly porous on either direction.

So the thesis was and no one agreed at the time. I certainly didn't that it would work but do our experiments first. We try and internal version on a little bit. Then you see him please start using it on Cotton. Maybe there's a there there. So you double click on a little bit make it a little bit better and what we saw by the end was that people just want to express themselves creatively to their friends and family or fans and it doesn't actually matter if that's something that lives on your profile permanently or whether it goes way in 24 hours and it's full screen. It doesn't matter Maybe. On new products that could be launched based on that Insight. We just got to in and then we're not there. So my take on the stories was that anything about jobs to be done in Sterling was being hired for a job and it had gotten like as an employee that my degraded performance and free time is here. I just got worse for that job. When you look at early Instagram. That's a lot more like stories people post four five times a day, whatever they wanted over time you have through when I think of as look through the natural laws of physics of feed product, which is it will start. Being more selective about what they post we would interview bunch of people over the years and they would come Express what the rules of Instagram were to us. So it was really funny to me and they would say you never double in stuff. What does that mean that you don't post twice a day maybe a prom like, okay. We not built intentionally, but we've evolved a product that is self-limiting in a way that the original version wasn't like just go back all the way in my peter Kevin.

How are they using it and just samples a bunch of their posts and it shows that you integrate okay female. Al's in France who are twenty-four to thirty seven I'm making these ages up.

I want you very quickly see is that although Instagrams Primitives are very basic and can use many different ways terms of groups of people use it in very specific ways.

I just got the Arab and measures sleep and in some cases, it's telling you what you already know that yeah, I didn't sleep very poorly last night, but I feel bad but also to me it was interesting to see like what does it look like when I am more stressed out before been to Paris variability.

I was in the mountains and I was like, I'm going to get away from it all and I grew up my beard and my days six of skiing. I was like, what am I doing up here? It was a lot of fun for 60 days. And then it was just cold. So I'm out there in mountains. We had moved out there were going to be there for three months or so and I decided and I would open up some books and I would start asking myself. What was interesting and I remember Mike had said he was taking a course at Stanford. I guess you were auditing or taking the online version of the machine learning course and I was like, oh machine learning. I've heard a lot about that. I should probably look into it helped us lauded instrument. It was phenomenally useful for making the site what it is today, but I never really understood the details. It just caught my eye and I sat down and started working on it and Amazon shipment after Amazon shipment of books come. To the house. I was reading all this stuff and I texted my guy was like like this AI stops really cool. So I mean if you look at the last six months or so, I guess we've been gone about a year. Now. Most of that time has been understanding the math behind modern machine learning and then implementing experiments and try it ourselves. But Mike was my inspiration there. What is your early opinion on the places that what you're learning can be applied most usefully whether that's in a business context or some other Text there's an engineer at Instagram who's our machine learning Guru and he had this amazing phrase which is machine learning. It's just not and I love that by the way, it is just not that's on Magic and tell the future. Well in some cases it might be able to tell the future, but we'll get to that but it's just not and if you just understand that it's just not then you understand that.

Whereas at least in the rodeo days. We knew our servers when Instagram launched the flood of people came in ever long and she's Services can keep up with demand. So we had to figure out what are we going to do? And I like to say the only time I can I have ever really got into an argument with whether or not we need another server. I didn't want another server except penny-pinching. We were start up a new what happened. Mike was like you have to get another server Mike was right, and we had to get a few more after that. It turns out but my point in telling Knowing the story is used to be that you had to have these physical thing and then we were out of BC's office and there are why don't you just use any WS what's AWS? And the second we going to AWS. It was like, wow, we just scale efficiently. And by the way, the things were scaling efficiently. We're all libraries that have been open sourced by many companies before we get started. I remember in the Odio days. What did you use as the caching layer? Maybe I'd really wrong thing and then it was memcache for us and then it became this other thing and this other Singing just the number of Open Source libraries that we could use for free to start a business AWS cost something but it was effectively scale for free. You could build a business for what I think we spent 65k total by launch day when we launched Instagram and that was a five hundred thousand dollars raised. Maybe we should have raised less. I don't know should I could have whatever right but now you will get it and you realize that I bought a book back in the day. I think it was called AI in Connor something was an O'Reilly book, but it was back in the day and it had an entire chapter on neural Nets. It was like how to create them from scratch the Renault libraries you can plug in anything. There were no server touch that you just spin up with everything installed and now we're in the place where actually you can do that scikit-learn exists and not to say that that's production-ready but it exists you can use it actually boosts were talking about the other day.

The second was keep it simple or do the simple thing first. We had just been bitten too many times when we try to make things really complex and then We realize wait that wasn't the right thing to do. It took us many months. Actually. We just do The Simple Solution. That's fine. And then speed was a huge one too. I mean early on we were so incredibly focused on making the app work really well on my terrible iPhone. This is the 3D. Yeah. Mike had the new version. He was fancy. I had the old one I get a disease through G. I think we know now that we don't know. On the battery gets low. The phone gets slower something now. I know it was happening, but it was slower than every other 3G of the world, but it was great because Kevin come in and be like it still doesn't work. Well this photo I know might want to move on. It was like Hey, we've got other projects to you man. I don't care that your feed stuttering. I was like, no we need to make this like glass and the fun part about Mike is he looks that he might be frustrated for all the half a second, but then he's like, I'm right this huge technical Challenge and when you get to that point where you open up the phone on the street in G. And it's like glass when you scroll now on every better phone. It's the best experience ever. So anyway, you asked if we had principles from the beginning. Yes, and then some speed is craft. It was Simplicity that's being Community First one wants to we have talked to us about unlocking people's creativity as well building tools that let you do feel like I've said this before but now I actually like I kept her something new and interesting and different not obviously evolved throughout the years best thing about all those they're Evergreen what they meant.

So I think that how I change and one of the challenges internally was helping people involved ask our initial Community, which is people who are super interested in iPhone photography and that was sort of a new thing at the time it's called iphoneography which nobody has ever called it that after 2010 because of course it's harder for you to take it with your phone to understanding that we were now dealing with a huge group of communities rather than just individual sort of initial user base. What were the hardest are some of the hardest challenges in that Community piece of the equation through the entire experience partisanship deal with I mean the list goes on because of a lot of when you just explain which is you're not dealing Find Community you're dealing with many community. So maybe I'll give two broad examples are two broad patterns one is changing the app. So maybe the first example if this was expanding to Android, which of course everyone now is like, of course you on Android it would be crazy not to but when we decided we were going to launch Android there was almost a community reporters, like now we're - ographers. And we have these beautiful phones and you're going to ruin Instagram. If you let those Android users on fun fact now, I guess Mike's on I'm looking over he's got an iPhone but for a while there you were using the Instagram could never get to over a billion people if it just focused solely on I fun so part of it is negotiating with your community in a way that isn't patronising about a big change that's happening. We know we have to get to this place, you know at some point.

It doesn't matter like very large pop figures. I know you adopted this app initially because you want to just follow best photographers in the world.

It's the stop for that should be Universal and not just unique to our own wants and needs it would be selfish as Leaders if we kept it to just our thing because what we want to do is build a platform not just a little app. So those changes I think we're hard. Hard the second is I would call it the relativism issue which is in the u.s. Nudity on public platforms generally not accepted. If you look at the App Store terms Etc. It's read a newspaper here. There's not new to the unit generally or magazines generally, but in Europe, it's a little different standards are different but it turns out as a platform you have to make one rule and how do you deal with the fact that France might see it one way and United States might see another and your one group, so Planning to people why certain things can be on the platform and certain things can't that's really tough because you're caught between different views on a subject. But when we see Community First and we're that big we don't mean the community runs the platform instead. It's okay. We wouldn't be here if these billion people didn't use this app. You can either treat it as if you are a dictator and charge of the thing that they use you have your views on policies and Cetera or you can view it as I'm really thankful. I have this job. I'm really thankful. All these people showed up some reason they continue to show up and then some how do I make it so that it's best for them and I think that the companies that do well in a long run understand that balance and really serve the community and say hey I'm going to do my absolute best, but it's going to be hard. I'm going to do my absolute best and that continues to I think cloud today on Instagram, it continues growing and people love it.

I found them both to be extremely good people who have a very Talent for finding and solving everything problems indeed problem solving and jobs to be done is a big part of our conversation. I realized walking into the podcast that Kevin and Mike also have a rare set of experiences having both built and sold an extremely successful product from scratch. But then also operating in scaled inside of one of the largest businesses in the world. This means they have unique knowledge to offer just about anybody interested in business and in products, we dig into all those lessons here. I'm working on hosting more Founders and CEOs on this podcast. Cast and can't think of a better pair to show you why I want to do. So, please enjoy my conversation with Kevin and Mike so gentlemen, we're going to talk about a lot of business related stuff. We'll talk about Instagram for short because I'm fascinated by what you learned both building the business from scratch and then also operating inside of a massive organization. There's like to begin with whatever has your interest and attention right now.

We needed to make in order to recapture being really good at the job that you were hired aspirationally, which is I want to really quickly share what I'm up to with my friends and then engage with them on it when they see what I'm up to what was the most interesting thing you saw as Instagram penetrated more into developing parts of the world. I'm assuming that you're successful sort of followed better bandwidth and better mobile penetration or something like that any interesting observations from us. Been really neat to watch that happen all sorts of it. Especially the last couple years of Instagram spent a lot of time thinking about we talked about Instagram emerging markets and how we make that work kind of things you notice in the US you can roll and Reviving generally the same quality of network connection throughout a day and that can vary wildly another country. So we sent a research team over to India and they would say I try to let up as much my feet as I can at home because I have Wi-Fi there and then I go out and really rate limited everywhere else. So we realize our product is actually not great for that because the second you went somewhere new try to Rest of the refresh failed to basically the product and stop working. So there's things you can do around thinking about people's day long experience of Instagram versus sort of single experience of Instagram. The other thing you start realizing is how cost plays a factor of one of our largest growth drivers ever internationally was this concept called zero rating or basically a carrier wants to get more customers. They'll say hey histogram is free for a month or Instagram is free up to this amount or its chemistry photos been obvious and the soft writer in India launched that feature. ER for Instagram and YouTube has incredible. What a rocket ship that was where the happened AT&T here. I don't think we'd see much more than a blip. Most people are either on blacks and update a plans or have universal life or like it's just not an issue. So you start realizing are the impediments to using a product different in different countries. Are you limited? Because most people are using a device Android device that you don't support get barking. We should probably go support that also an interesting example we had was we would often look at what version of Instagram people were signing. \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"82ab9926387c4e40ab40b3f475ff5448\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:47:59Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T13:48:00.540344346Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:45:59Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T13:49:02.936006954Z\", \"confidence\": 0.80103485, \"recordingId\": \"e58b5268a13944bb875aaec76663eb65\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"And I think almost to a fault we were very intentional about every sort of decision to be made along the way and I think that comes from that balance of the distressed of matter.

This is in this also commit and go forward. One of the phrases really liked was the case study. We both studied independently chose. We may not be right, but we're not confused and we love that because it really captures the can't basically try to diversify. Apply your effort when you're two people got to be boys reply focus on one thing but you're also have the devotees like we might not be write a story like to tell is bergen.com, which is the product that we built before Instagram that's like and product was active and we're ready to Pivot back to it after we launched Instagram if that hadn't worked for hours into the launch of Instagram is clearly working at to turn it off because the server was overloaded. We're just turning up left and right anything that we could but I woke up in the morning. We want Justice around. I was like, I hope this works, but give it doesn't I'm not done want to keep going so I got money. Back, but figure out what's next the two other areas that it's funny to talk too much about a business and not touched on these two areas yet Instagram again is unusual in this sort of build it and they came distribution sort of handled itself. I'm sure that there were a lot of things that went into thinking about its growth but seemed to grow pretty fast just by relief from the jump which is unusual obviously for a business to distribution is the first growth and then the second is the business model. So this is a free product and now it makes money or some of the ways which makes money. Yeah, but how often did you guys think or do you think about growth distribution building those channels intentionally versus just letting it be letting the best possible product handle growth on its own because it's that good so a little bit of both. How do you manage it? And then how do you not going to its way how we manage it? I mean Mike I would spend a ton of time early on optimizing the landing page. So it's three good but I said the three problems that we've solved one of them was sharing on multiple platforms and it turns out we both love. \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"6304f233f2514b8eb04fc5f2d4737bc2\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T14:01:59Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T14:02:00.518336129Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:59:59Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T14:03:02.170628708Z\", \"confidence\": 0.78458481, \"recordingId\": \"5b12807830b84b839ce051956fddeb07\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"Very specific athletes in their own Arena, but it never quite clicked and for me, I went outside of venture startups and I said who just thinks the way I like to think very logically if that's cool.

We're an Instagram and some of the ways they run Bridgewater and man that can be more different but having a very specific View and holding on to it. I thought it was something that was really special regardless of whether you're right. I think I learned a lot from him to think a little bit more principle of about what we were doing and what are the rules of the road inside of Instagram? What do we believe one of the things we think are true universally throughout Building Product and the more we started coming around and writing those values down some I call them principles. I call them values for Instagram the more I realize actually you can apply that over and over again.

My goal is for college the last my entire life, even if I'm not paying for it. So I love those answers and I got this image of Mike when you were talking about anything that you're going to be really successful almost by definition. It means, you know, five percent of the stuff that you're going to know that that end State what could be more exciting than that. My closing question for everybody is to ask for the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for me. I can go first. Don't worry about yeah is the good thing about having two people for that? Okay, so kind of thing it's hard because there are a lot of kind things along the way but the one that stands out to me as my uncle when I was in fourth grade. So this way then think 94 I was getting into computers and I had this curiosity and here in this computer business and he could tell I was excited about it and I have learned some Q basic programming remember that Mike qbasic. I was playing around with and showed him that I was excited we go. Get her in the house and my dad was doing it for work. My mom needed a family sharing and one time. I don't remember exactly when he came to our house and he pulled out a laptop and I still remember it because the screen was green and black it wasn't black and white. It was black and green. He said here you can have this and I don't even remember if it's just random daus or something it basically let me start programming and I had it in my room and I remember the table and sat on and I would use it every single night for hours on end and some doing my um work and \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": false}, {\"id\": \"628e7c62928542989232d9233bc97b55\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T12:56:54Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T12:56:55.527717359Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T12:54:54Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T12:57:57.231503923Z\", \"confidence\": 0.844100685, \"recordingId\": \"97cbc158d0634b8ea84d4d5f31cd8a16\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"I think what we always try to do is Bridge the things that were really unscalable type of support tickets ourselves at the beginning or still coding for a really long time Fatima scaling and then obviously trying to grow the company for scale.

There's this really interesting thrust of startups that are general purpose tools productivity. Tools for lack of a better term that can do a million different things but they don't seem to do any one thing that you actually need which is a good excuse to talk about your guys's interest in this job should be done framework. And this is an important part of how you thought about things like Instagram. I'd love to hear just kind of from the beginning why you find this idea compelling and how you think other business people can use it to their advantage. Well from the beginning we always said you have to solve a problem. So if you're going to build a product the only reason that should exist the world is because it's all someone's problem. And when we started Instagram we listed out but the top three problems were with mobile photos at the time. So number one was that most people thought their photos were terrible Because by the way, they were there with the blurry lens. It was not an old camera or not. No camera, but it was the sensor was terrible. It was just at the beginning of digital photography. The second was that people wanted to be able to share their photos everywhere. They were fragmented between a bunch of different services. So they were on Twitter they were on Facebook they were on at the time of posterous horse where you are across all these services and you just wanted to take one photo and one place and the last one was speed. It was so slow to not only take a photo but also get it onto one of these Services because I don't remember a transfer speeds were on average but felt like it took a couple minutes often and this was when you can't remember if at the beginning Instagram, you were allowed to background apps. Remember we couldn't actually background a nap and then I couldn't upload the photo much. \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": true}, {\"id\": \"82f3c6543e354564ba898e20aa718e9e\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:04:54Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T13:04:55.629973616Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T13:02:54Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T13:06:03.180869676Z\", \"confidence\": 0.7694358625000001, \"recordingId\": \"e6eb918aa18f498dab8a0ad6e7d9565e\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"Just make sure that your communities healthy.

And then when they sold a new in Toledo, so of course they would lead to much this was 2013. Here's your free any inkling of a Commerce product inside Instagram and you're like, oh these people are quote unquote misusing the product but the reason for this very real easy. Because they want to transact and the comments say how much is it and the responsibilities 50 and once that maybe that's how they would get payment in the hole completely external Instagram infrastructure was getting created by people who found any because they have the audience there so you can ask. All right. Is there a job to be done that's adjacent to the jobs. We already do think that's important. I feel like companies fail when they are getting hired for one job up. There were jealous of another job. They wish they got hired for that's the way out of left field and they launched a product and they wonder why Josh reading all these In the product, why are they just for this other thing? I think you always need to build and he's adjacency. So people were already getting inspired on Instagram and seeing interesting products. Now, you can also buy them that feels like a pretty normal link. Where is that that behavior beginning exist on Instagram and you watch the cars product would probably swap because there's no existing behavior that you can sort of divert or build upon the net change a lot of the years where it sounds like there's just tons of examples of observing behavior and realizing there's a job happening that you can amplify and provide a better tool kit for Even when that was happening were you also just coming up with classic jobs think no one asked her and I found you have to sort of anticipate the needs of your customers versus just observe and accommodate them. I mean people were asking for an iPhone. That's the crazy part. If you look at a Nokia smartphones with little games and everything the terrible what was it called that yeah. Thanks. Wow.

So people are like, oh, how did you do this at so we actually did architected very well at the same time. We have no Idea, what was happening underneath so you didn't know how many new users we were acquiring versus how many were turning out versus how many were resurrecting you didn't really have those metrics dialed in but once we did get those metrics dialed in we realized very quickly that often when growth wasn't going. Well it was because of something we had screwed up. So we were like get out of the way of the thing growing we're screwing it up. I mean might has a bunch of stories about push notifications not working or how do we scroll down? We don't know exactly and we would look at and say like wow that's broken off a cliff. People change their competitor and I ninety-nine out of a hundred times. It was the push notification system broke. That was a very very common one or someone getting the thing broke memorably once we shipped a version that crashed every time you try to upload a photo if you were in Japan in this game is very specific crazy region-specific bugs and need to make some changes as we grew where like, it's hard to find a username that seems like a trivial problem. So running out of usernames. How do you help people through that sign up process is not the same way. You would help them through it at the very very beginning, but I think going back to the surface. A metaphor the way you distribute and grow is also very much tied to when you're building in people. Come to me all the time. Like hey, I'm launching an app. What should I do to make it as big as gravel my time travel back to 2010. I have a conversation because it's a different thing the Avenues of growth we had for example, we shared a lot on Twitter and Facebook and then you would get attribution and even sure backpedaling that's the case for either of those platforms anymore.

Leave people listening with that you've gleaned from your experience advice or otherwise never a self-selecting out of things because you don't feel like you know them yet. When you look at us, we were not people with computer science degrees. I degree in human future action, Kevin green management science and engineering that we knew some programming, but when I think I found a photo recently from week one and a half of Instagram and friend Sean is sitting next to me and I think it's coming straight in the captain's like working on the server's something like that and it was a friend of mine who worked at the previous start up with you come over and try to Help me with some of this connecting.

I'm never going to be good at any of those other things they can try to be something else but the values that we have internally or kind of like our DNA and all I know is keeping things simple. I may be out of necessity because when we started an Instagram was the best of all the things we raise money. Or an HTML5 web app not a nap. Why not because I thought HTML5 was future. I didn't know how to make an app. So I had to keep it simple. So again when you asked if we did it again where we keep all those same principles absolutely us but not forget that we could choose to but because we have to so the community thing is fascinating to me. How do you manage a community when the community point the you left used to world? It's just a slice of the entire world. So I understand cultivating Community. I think that's super important. When you can sort of draw boundaries about what makes a community a community, but now you're dealing with the entire human populace and that remains an important thing. So did you manage that challenge? I think realizing that we have a team for a while is called a community Team rhapsodic all the communities team because ultimately that's what you get you get this sort of amalgamation of a bunch of communities and then I think interesting challenge becomes how do you different points of time go deep on one or the other and understand how they're using the product and whether their sleep due to cultivate that so I mentioned commerce's One of them dependent so people like I went back home to Brazil. I got to meet a bunch of entrepreneurs for whom it's around was their storefront. That's an interesting Community who can you connect with other people doing the same thing so they can share insights for a community might be just a Civic. So what we would do is send research teams out. I send Engineers with them because I think having insights huge percent was always interesting and then come back and say hey just spent the week f****** the French teams.

Hope that you have a sticker and go back to their so that Playbook is obviously new and different so that always was evolving and always changing and also became Function of scale to for us like what we were trying to acquire earlier people were into Twitter and Facebook and using photos. You're acquiring your billion first person thinking all right there in a different country and they heard of Instagram it are you afraid of it's about making sure they know that friends are on there. It's about thinking more creatively but never forgetting them block and tackle basics of growth because that was often where we would have to turn to and since that thing that is what we need to focus on I'm curious is it was a free product how early on you were Deliberately about the economic model for whether it's ads or whatever else. What role does that play in this whole story? I'm smiling just because in order to get Mike to work at Instagram is Brazilian was Brazilian or long Brazilian. I guess you'll always be resilient. Yeah, but we had to get an H-1B visa and they didn't believe that the company was real. They were like his sister she'll accompany or you just trying to get so Mike. What was your first assignment? I didn't so basically they're like the species that we can't prove it until we have more information to sending us. Your business plan making sure the governor's like of course, they have a business, but they don't we let them till they're all alike worst was in this plan. We'd raised on a hope and a dream and an app demo which Kevin had raised those even involved in so I wrote up a business plan to capture our hopes and dreams about bourbon or she's a proper working on and the business model the time is that it was all about local Discovery.

I have this one mentors like yeah you figured out I'd be a great entrepreneur but being a great investor. It's a completely different game and unless you approach it with that humility. I might actually be pretty bad at this. So, how can I learn? Is this possible? I think that's the only way to figure out this next chapter investing. Again, I don't know if it's 10% of her time with 90% of her time but it's a fun game to figure out off so different as much as it was similar. We walked into a meeting with the DCCC month or two ago. And he's like biggest thing I've learned in my career as a PC Product doesn't really matter go to market is everything but you know, the muss were like what and that could be the right pieces baby within that category of things and think if that were the case, I won't think I would enjoy resting because if there is any amount of air Edge or unique view we have on the world. I think it's what problems are solved how well the product is solving those problems and what team is going on solving these problems and how are they tackling what's doing uq of the problem and I have to believe that is an interesting view on the world and hold lead to some ability to spot things. Although maybe it doesn't lead to go despondent very early. So I think we're in the total discovery mode of understanding where we add value as well so far.

And you also mentioned this idea of being thoughtful about training people inside histogram, whether it be the individual contributor track for the management track. What were some major mentors that you guys had an impact on your thinking. Well, the people I met in college actually close taking a class on digital design and Building Things is Reid Hoffman and at the time he was still mostly involved with LinkedIn and hadn't yet thought about maybe doing a little bit of investable with long Venture yet and Thing about metros that for your team that you have learned from each of them and for Rita that gets leveraged he goes and says, hey, I want to make this podcast happen. I want to make this book happens. I get some be great to partner with and then make that happen. I think for my other self reflection. I'm the kind of person that tries to do too much myself. Like of course, I can figure this out and the answer isn't that you couldn't have it's that one. There's probably somebody else out there think about it for much longer and faster and better and to of that incremental minute. We spend to give us some different things so that question of Leverage. And how to scale yourself as one of them on stuff reflection need to be even more mindful of now that we don't have a team anymore because my literally there's no delegation that can happen right now. What are we working on tomorrow is all that's getting done right now in this partnership. So for me, it actually came later on an Instagram because early on I was like, yeah, I mean everyone looks up to Steve Jobs everyone looks up to Bill Gates and I think they should because it's an enormously successful and what they do, but it wasn't like a personal relationship or we go back to being specific athletes.

We try not to sort of have to watch things will make these have decisions and instead say let's go for it and we'll deal with the consequence of figuring out the other side of it didn't work how extreme were some of these Solutions. So maybe at the end what percent of usage on uses like FaceTime or screen time was video and Stories versus the original filtered photos. Not sure I remember the exact time spent on all of them, but let me put it this way regular Instagram. You to grow time spent per users the way we measured it. So how many minutes per day daily active basically that continues to grow over X doing? Okay, and then we launched a couple things one was machine learning ranking for our feed. So it was like, okay now you have too much in your feed if you get bored after the third thing because everyone's posting all the time you turn off and so we're going to filter through and basically say, what do we think you're going to enjoy the most that an enormous impact on them spent the other one actually? \", \"transcriptId\": \"90a708b6-9ef3-41f2-9826-d3a7a630d571\", \"isEndOfSentence\": false}, {\"id\": \"132ece3f6a804c09af66e5d172511af9\", \"status\": \"completed\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-11-20T12:48:54Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"70caa6269d8e4869a45f7ea91ade3472\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-11-20T12:48:55.594566443Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-11-20T12:46:54Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-11-20T12:49:57.437660478Z\", \"confidence\": 0.825929275, \"recordingId\": \"1e16c9bea46446fdaeae0b09fd0212b1\", \"transcriber\": \"google_speech_api\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"And of course you can get to better outcomes at the end of the day.

It sounds like maybe a trike phrase, but you see it and I saw an Instagram to when you are building a machine Learning System the way that you try to increase your accuracy that feature. So for instance, I might be Beware was the photo taken. How many legs does it have and you start with the obvious ones and then all of a sudden you find your team is mostly doing featuring Arabs long long tail of stuff. Like which direction was the camera pointed making some of these up. What was the weather that day and they might actually have some predictive power in the short term, but you're probably over fitting the data and you get really excited and at least all sorts of weird effects Downstream if you haven't actually created one, so I guess to directly answer your question. I think it's places where the quantity and quality of data. Gotten to the point where it actually is useful to throw out the it's just math approach on and try to yield a generally useful prediction in a way that might be different than having hundreds of analysts try to extract some meeting in the same data.

I mean so many companies getting away from solving a problem or being hired by consumers because they just assume too much going to stay the same. They assume people would never use a phone without a physical keyboard. They assume no one would ever use a mobile only photo-sharing service because of course you're going to want to upload from your camera that you hook up to your desktop with a cable. You spent so much money on it. Why wouldn't you just stick with that thing the companies that question the fundamental assumption during an enormous transition of Technology meaning there's this wave of mobile that comes and no one quite knows how it's going to play. But everyone knows that I don't know there's camera touch you can take advantage of that wave and say listen, there's an unmet need of sharing photos with your friends on these mobile devices. No one's touched it yet. We can do it in a slightly better way. I think that's where companies end up taking on. However lie in Instagrams history. Were you planting to call them core values or principles around product over from day one as a user of Instagram? That stands out is visual Simplicity are seeing some of these WeChat and China would send a million things going on. Now that works for them huge product but Instagram extremely elegantly simple. So how early did you plant some of these principles? How did you arrive at the principles themselves? That's funny.

It turned out to be great for growth by the way. And then last one we were most proud of was as you were captioning your photo we would Actually upload the photo in the background regardless of whether or not you completed because okay will upload it. And if you say cancel will throw it away, but if you say hey, here's my whole caption that I spent five minutes figure out what to say to some clever turns out all that time. Your phone's been uploading backgrounds. When you click done within a fraction of a second it says done and you're like wait, but I thought I had to go upload it now and that little sleight of hand meant that Instagram felt enormously fast compared to all the other ones so By focusing on those three problems, I think and by the way a bit of luck and timing Instagram was at the right place at the right time and it's solved or poems run something people clearly want to do so later on and Instagram. So we always had that phrase which is solve a problem that came across clay Christensen smoke competing against lock. Actually. I came across one of his writings in a different form where he mentions this but then found out he wrote a book about it. So reading about jobs to be done theory was one of the most transformative experiences for us. Acid Instagram because we realized that's what we had meant when we said solve the problem. So jobs to be done is effectively people need this product in their lives to solve a problem for them. So what are they hiring it to do it sounds a little weird to hire a product.

So we both had to optimize for time but also optimized to see your friends and turns out that pivot in optimizing torture friends had an enormous boost to the usage of the app as well and we thought that It was pretty good. And then it turns out stories came along and stories was there's some trade-off but it was highly additive and you look at Instagrams time spent today, and I'm not internal so I don't know where it's at anymore, but we had no idea that we could have multiple chapters of success in terms of expanding the time people spend on Instagram by again focusing on what we talked about before solving the problems that people have in their lives. They want to know what's happening with their friends. They want to know what's happening with celebrities and These public figures and they don't want to trade off between the two.

And I remember the general area Tom don't remember the building, but we would walk in and have to wear these your covers just really loud and we bring your jacket and we just like go reboot the servers and we have eight on a rack.

What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview. This is a chance for them to call out and explain any certain skills or experience or things that might make uncertainty and high on you and so asking this question shows that you understand you're not a perfect candidate but then you do wanna to know what you can done better by the same and token if they do share something with you you now have an opportunity to say oh but I didn't share this experience or maybe I need to tell you about this feels that I ask it's a chance for me to but become that objection maybe be realizing that you can give them everything they needed to to hear space.

So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we're getting the information we need and that's what I'm gonna show you next. So we're starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side. This is a great place for that to work. So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they're like as a worker. The second question is what left knows about working here. So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer. This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company. Whilst you're gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you'd really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company's stupid for you. So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not. It's a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company. The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role. This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully. I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that's something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they're recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this.",

So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it. What you're doing. There's is showing that that you understand you're a business of one your service provider and that what you're going to do is help them solve a about and alleviate your team. So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you're really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I'm having a positive impact on this challenge. Once again you're taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I'm supposed to do that you're sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that's a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there's no real way to measure we won't have any idea whether or not you're making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you're gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company can't measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably don't want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you're talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that's how to properly close up this conversation. So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great.",

It involves an autonomous agent like a person animal robot or deep net learning to navigate and uncertain environment with the goal of maximizing a numerical reward love sports are a great example of this just look at what our autonomous agent would have to deal with tennis match. The agent would have to consider its actions like it serves returns and volleys these actions change the state of the game or in other words the current Set the leading player things like that. And every action is performed with a rewarding life winning a point in order to win the game set and match. Our agent needs to follow a policy or set of rules and strategies in order to maximize the final score. But if you were building an autonomous agent, how would you actually model this? We know that the agents actions will change the state of the environment. So a model would need to be able to take a state and an action is input and generate the maximum expected reward as output. But since that only gets you to the next state he will need to take into account the total expected reward for every action from the current till the end state. The way this works will be different for every application and you are probably not surprised to know that building its head is Agent is different from building an Atari agent the researchers at deepmind use a series of Atari screenshots to build a convolutional neural network with a couple of tweaks. The output was not a class but instead it was a target number for the maximum reward. They also did not use pooling layers since unlike image recognition individual positions of game objects with the player are all important and cannot be deuce a recurrent net could have been used to as long as the output layer was tailored for regression the input of each time step and could it be action in the environment State? There is also the Deep Q Network or dqn for short dqn also uses the principles of predicting the maximum reward given a state and action. It was actually patented by Google and it is seen a lot of improvements like the experience replay.\n",

The primary role is strategic which helps to find business strategy relative to human capital and its contribution to organizational results. The Strategic role helps link human resource strategy with organizational Mission and the work of people in the organization. The operational and employee Advocate role manages most HR activities in keeping with organizational strategy in serving as an employee Champion to balance the issues of employees and employer.

And just a little over a month later Google announced the day since then there's been all kinds of talk about reinforcement learning in the field of AI in January of 2016 Google announced that the appropriately named alphago was able to beat the reigning go champion of the world. We're going to take the mystery out of reinforcement learning so you can see how all these amazing feats are possible. \n",

      "Three of reinforcement learning goes all the way back to AI animal psychology and control theory at the heart of it. It involves an autonomous agent like a person animal robot or deep net learning to navigate and uncertain environment with the goal of maximizing a numerical reward love sports are a great example of this just look at what our autonomous agent would have to deal with tennis match. The agent would have to consider its actions like it serves returns and volleys these actions change the state of the game or in other words the current Set the leading player things like that. And every action is performed with a rewarding life winning a point in order to win the game set and match. Our agent needs to follow a policy or set of rules and strategies in order to maximize the final score. But if you were building an autonomous agent, how would you actually model this? We know that the agents actions will change the state of the environment. So a model would need to be able to take a state and an action is input and generate the maximum expected reward as output. But since that only gets you to the next state he'll need to take into account the total expected reward for every action from the current till the end state. The way this works will be different for every application and you're probably not surprised to know that building its head is Agent is different from building an Atari agent the researchers at deepmind use a series of Atari screenshots to build a convolutional neural network with a couple of tweaks. The output wasn't a class but instead it was a target number for the maximum reward. So it was actually dealing with regression not classification. They also didn't use pooling layers since unlike image recognition individual positions of game objects with the player are all important and can't be deuce a recurrent net could have been used to as long as the output layer was tailored for regression the input of each time step and could it be action in the environment State? There's also the Deep Q Network or dqn for short dqn also uses the principles of predicting the maximum reward given a state and action. It was actually patented by Google and it's seen a lot of improvements like the experience replay. \n",

      "Three of reinforcement learning goes all the way back to AI animal psychology and control theory at the heart of it. It involves an autonomous agent like a person animal robot or deep net learning to navigate and uncertain environment with the goal of maximizing a numerical reward love sports are a great example of this just look at what our autonomous agent would have to deal with tennis match. The agent would have to consider its actions like it serves returns and volleys these actions change the state of the game or in other words the current Set the leading player things like that. And every action is performed with a rewarding life winning a point in order to win the game set and match. Our agent needs to follow a policy or set of rules and strategies in order to maximize the final score. But if you were building an autonomous agent, how would you actually model this? We know that the agents actions will change the state of the environment. So a model would need to be able to take a state and an action is input and generate the maximum expected reward as output. But since that only gets you to the next state he will need to take into account the total expected reward for every action from the current till the end state. The way this works will be different for every application and you are probably not surprised to know that building its head is Agent is different from building an Atari agent the researchers at deepmind use a series of Atari screenshots to build a convolutional neural network with a couple of tweaks. The output was not a class but instead it was a target number for the maximum reward. They also did not use pooling layers since unlike image recognition individual positions of game objects with the player are all important and cannot be deuce a recurrent net could have been used to as long as the output layer was tailored for regression the input of each time step and could it be action in the environment State? There is also the Deep Q Network or dqn for short dqn also uses the principles of predicting the maximum reward given a state and action. It was actually patented by Google and it is seen a lot of improvements like the experience replay. \n",

We're going to take the mystery out of reinforcement learning so you can see how all these amazing feats are possible. \n",

      "Three of reinforcement learning goes all the way back to AI animal psychology and control theory at the heart of it. It involves an autonomous agent like a person animal robot or deep net learning to navigate and uncertain environment with the goal of maximizing a numerical reward love sports are a great example of this just look at what our autonomous agent would have to deal with tennis match. The agent would have to consider its actions like it serves returns and volleys these actions change the state of the game or in other words the current Set the leading player things like that. And every action is performed with a rewarding life winning a point in order to win the game set and match. Our agent needs to follow a policy or set of rules and strategies in order to maximize the final score. But if you were building an autonomous agent, how would you actually model this? We know that the agents actions will change the state of the environment. So a model would need to be able to take a state and an action is input and generate the maximum expected reward as output. But since that only gets you to the next state he'll need to take into account the total expected reward for every action from the current till the end state. The way this works will be different for every application and you're probably not surprised to know that building its head is Agent is different from building an Atari agent the researchers at deepmind use a series of Atari screenshots to build a convolutional neural network with a couple of tweaks. The output wasn't a class but instead it was a target number for the maximum reward. So it was actually dealing with regression not classification. They also didn't use pooling layers since unlike image recognition individual positions of game objects with the player are all important and can't be deuce a recurrent net could have been used to as long as the output layer was tailored for regression the input of each time step and could it be action in the environment State? There's also the Deep Q Network or dqn for short dqn also uses the principles of predicting the maximum reward given a state and action. It was actually patented by Google and it's seen a lot of improvements like the experience replay. \n",

      "What are the responsibilities of UI designer?\n",
      "Were user experience design is all about user experiencing the product and having a delightful interaction with it.\n",
      "User interface design is its visual animals cousin so to speak it is all about the look and feel and the interaction and the presentation of the product itself and some of you might be saying does not that helped me have a better user experience.\n",
      "Yes, it does and that is why there is some crossover some gray area in these but UI design is more closely related to the visual communication Arts like graphic design as in picking colors and typography and making things really beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at job.\n",

      "Alright chris so let us give an call this person we want hear one three.\n",
      "Here is their story like what is the story is this degree.\n",

      "Now depends on your time and your experience your location.\n",
      "If you are near a large city if you are not in your large city that there is plenty resources online.\n",
      "So as long as you are working those basic design principles, you can kind of transition them over to UI design.\n",
      "So there it is the differences between UI design and ux design some overlap a little bit of similarity, but very very different one of them being more cognitive and more analytical the other one being more visual problem solving and aesthetically driven.\n",
      "All of the needs and the structure and everything that somebody like user experience designer has done and then take that and put that into an attractive and aesthetically pleasing platform to be received by users.\n",
      "It is a standard for UI designers to also be thinking about you know, animation interactivity prototyping a UI designer also adapts their designs to fit every screen size and resolution.\n",
      "Well UI designer is not necessarily a branding designer.\n",
      "If they interface for like an application or website.\n",
      "I would think even more resources to learn I design design and visual design.\n",
      "Then there actually is for something such user experience fine.\n",
      "Although we use a below of those basics client principles which I just love and think are just the investing in so as long important basic design principles.\n",
      "So there is the difference thing between you and UX design some overlap a little bit of similarities, but very very different.\n",
      "Let me make this even simpler a ux designer is going to pass off the skeleton and the UI designer is going to put on the skin and the clothes and dress that thing simplify can put a pizza what responsibilities does a UI designer half Numero Uno and the biggest bread and butter is the look and feel of the product a UI designer will do a good competitive analysis of what is going on in that same Market.\n",
      "So whether their website design is being viewed on a desktop or a mobile device or maybe an Xbox XnumberX has to look good in all of those different aspects and then also can UI designer is responsible for interacting with the developer and making sure that things look and feel and work the way that they should this is when the development and the ux and the UI Team all kind of come together and they are making sure everything that is supposed to be every step of the way.\n",
      "All of the needs and the structure and everything that somebody like to use your experience designer has done and then take that and put that into in attractive aesthetically pleasing platform to be received by users.\n",
      "Let me make this even simpler a uX designer is going pas on skeleton and the UI designer is going to put on the scan closed and direct that knife people responsibility does use entire and the biggest sprint is the look and feel of the product the UI designer will do a good compettive alysis of what is going on in that same market what is like the standard what is a good look and field join a design research to make sure that the product makes sense like the designer is not a children application of making a look like a for walk, then designer just gonna to do all of the graph additional design for project.\n",
      "So whether there websites being viewed on a desktop for mobile device or maybe an cost three have to look good in all of those different aspects and then also the designer you is responsible for interacting was developer and making sure that things look and feel and all work the way that they should this report to development and the UX and the UI team all kind of come together and they making sure everything that is supposed to be every step way a UI designer.\n",
      "It is not necessarily a branding designer.\n",
      "Things and so it is that that and beyond thing need to make sure that feedback beyond mobile of site absolutely expressed what that beyond is all about taking any brand any a company and the UI designer role to make sure that that is expressed through the interface itself.\n",
      "Were talking buttons and interactions, which all that kind of visual stuff nowadays.\n",
      "Parfaits and so the Bed Bath and Beyond they need to make sure the Bed Bath  Beyond.Commensurate with your experience starting to sound like job application.\n",
      "Although uses a lot of those basic design principles, which I just love and think are just the best thing ever.\n",
      "What of that being more than more alytical the other one being more visual problem solving seventy driven.\n",

      "There is a stack of different options.\n",
      "That is a really big deal.\n",
      "So far, it is just been cosmetic changes.\n",
      "We renamed dependencies.\n",
      "Weve moved things around a little bit hidden things under the WWE route, but we are going to get into some more concrete details here in a minute.\n",
      "For example, we have app settings dot Json.\n",
      "This is where we store all of our configuration.\n",
      "For example, if we have a connection to a database that would go in here possibly.\n",
      "But in this is where asp.net and.net core in general kind of takes it to the next level compared to the full framework.\n",
      "This is just one type of configuration option for dotnet court.\n",
      "And in fact, it is not the configuration option.\n",
      "They recommend for things like connection strings.\n",
      "Everyone is concern on connection strings for good reason they give away the security or database.\n",
      "Now for a web application not a huge deal to control the web server, but it does not they can consider it of well with core applications.\n",
      "For example, as your key volts, which is an Azure.\n",
      "It is very very cheap and stored securely encrypted your most sensitive information and that can plug in just like it was here in your app settings dot Json and in fact, it will look at multiple locations.\n",
      "It will select the highest Priority One that finds so you can have your absence dot Json to your local development, but then have your a jerky volt override that automatically in production even Dev or staging so really at the next level also, this is Json very easy to write.\n",
      "It is just been cosmetic changes the dependencies.\n",
      "Weve moved to that things others rooms.\n",
      "Next we have a three four controllers models and views which we have models and views as well, but thing has our spurs things as well, for example content fonts scripts and of course that is the playback.\n",
      "So that is where can it is a little up here input those things like fonts they were growing in the root folder because our static files so kind clean of it break it down to a stand what is going out of we got three folders controller models views makes a little more sense.\n",
      "Tell that net framework not really is pretty close the same thing as what you will find in dot framework.\n",
      "So there is not a lot changes as far as you can jump breaking it down net core and most stuff is just gonna work the same way that is a deal now let us look add a layout page.\n",
      "So there is not a lot changed as far as you can jump right in a.net core and most the stuff is just going to work the same way.\n",
      "As our full framework application is dependent on all these references.\n",
      "This dww rudes is where we store our static files things like our CSS or JavaScript even static HTML Pages can go in here.\n",
      "We do not have that type of thing in our MVC application.\n",
      "It lives right in the the main folder.\n",
      "It is a little difference a little bit more separation better understanding of what goes where.\n",
      "As our full framework application is dependent on all these references.\n",
      "So it is the same concept you have to better name as a better group as well okay we come down to core we have you we do not have a that down here in a full framework.\n",
      "If will restore our static files things like our CSS Javascript is even static html pages can go in here we have that kind of thing that our application.\n",
      "This is where we store all of our configurations.\n",
      "This is just one type of configuration option for dot Corp in fact, it is not the configuration option.\n",
      "So the next level also this is JSon very easy to write.\n",
      "They recommend for things like and connections strings and I connections strings reason they give three of now for it went the huge healthy control the web server but something they can consider well with core applications.\n",
      "Let is look at the layout page.\n",
      "So for example this the icon for our website lives inside www route, but down here in MVC.\n",
      "So for example, this the icon for our website live inside route, but down here it is right in the the main folder.\n",
      "But we are not to get some more concrete detail here a minute for example, we have app not Json.\n",
      "There is a stack of different options for example, Azure which even as they are very to and stored and encrypted your most sensitive animation and then can point in just like you was hearing or not selling that Json in fact it will look at multiple locations and based on your priority will select those highest one that finds so how you are absent such chase on your local development but then have your Azure override that in production even or staging.\n",
      "For example, if attention or database going here possibly but and this is where a S p dot met he socket at core in general had takes a next level compared to the full framework.\n",
      "So is pretty much the same thing as our full framework about their about down views about okay so they can show it with almost of the same the code is fairly similar.\n",
      "He is pretty close to the same thing as what you will find in dotnet framework.\n",
      "The analog of this is the web.config much more stuff here and it is XML harder right too hard to read hard to create systems that actually work the way you expect them to so definitely an upgrade their also web config does not have great.\n",
      "So that is kind of a downside of dotnet framework.\n",
      "Tell that is dotnet core not dotnet framework.\n",
      "I am not going to go to Azure when I have got the web.config.\n",
      "This data route.\n",
      "So it is it is the same a similar concept if you have a better name as better grouping as well.\n",
      "It is a little difference a little bit more separation that understanding how what those.\n",

      "You know those are that is what life is about and if you do not have any of those things well you have got left is and suffering.\n",
      "Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I will work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes.\n",
      "I do not know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you are negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that is how you make the schedule it is like and then you think well if I have that day that I would be good great you know and you are useless and so you are probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you are going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you would like to have.\n",

      "So it is like well, what kind of schedule are you setting up?\n",
      "It is like raw set the damn schedule up so that you have.\n",
      "So that is that is a bad that is a bad deal for you so number specify by your because how are going hit something if you do not know what it is is that is not going to happen and often be specify their goal too because they do not like to specify conditions for failure.\n",
      "So you known like you chose us not to okay so once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this like looks like that might be worth than having despite the fact that it is going to be you know exciting promote and threatening and there is going to be some suffering and loss involved at all of that obviously the goal is have a vision for your life such that all things considered not just advise your efforts.\n",
      "Well this is what I aiming for how does that understand itself day day we do we month a month and that is where something like the schedule can be unbelievable is a Google calendar.\n",
      "It is like native day schedule and stick to it.\n",
      "Okay so what is the rule with the schedule.\n",
      "There you want that is the trick it is like okay I got tomorrow if I was going to set up so the best possible day.\n",
      "I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there is a bit responsibility that is going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you are going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you are not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that is a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it is like sorry, that is just not a good strategy.\n",
      "So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay?\n",
      "And that is hard for people because they do not like themselves very much they are always like back in the web and then procrastinating and cracking the way them procrastinating against like so such a way is spending your time and you know what that is like because you probably wait like six hours a day what you do now is going to it is in the future.\n",
      "Okay you do then they he turn down to the micro it is like okay?\n",
      "That is the first thing that people do wrong is well I do not like how all let us schedules was like what kind of schedule are you are setting up well I have to do this.\n",
      "Then I have to do this and I have to do this you know and then I just go play video because we wants to do all these things that I have to do like said schedule.\n",
      "So that is that is a bad.\n",
      "So to speak someone that you have to negotiate with and you someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a those life too.\n",
      "And you do that by referring to social norms that is more less you your father from the value of the way, but the way the other are way you do that is how a conversation with yourself about if you do not really know who you are are because you know what you are like you will not do you are told you will not do what you tell yourself to do you must have noticed that it is like you are a bad employee and a worse loss and going into those for you you do not know what you want to do and then when you tell yourself what do you do not do it anyway but you know my point that you have to understand that you are not your own servant.\n",
      "So number one specify your damn golf because how are you going to hit something?\n",
      "If you do not know what it is that is not going to happen and often people will specify their goals to because they do not like to specify conditions for failure.\n",
      "So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that is just a matter of not doing as well.\n",
      "So I will keep myself blind about when I fail that is fine, except you will fail all the time.\n",
      "So once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this life looks like that might be worth living despite the fact that it is going to be, you know, anxiety provoking and threatening and there is going to be some suffering and loss involved in all of that.\n",
      "Well, then then you turn down to the micro routines like, okay.\n",
      "How does that instantiate itself day to day week to week month to month?\n",
      "It is not a bloody prison.That is the first thing that people do wrong.\n",

      "Now for a web application not a huge deal to control the web server, but it does not they can consider it of well with core applications.\n",
      "For example, as your key volts, which is an Azure.\n",
      "It is very very cheap and stored securely encrypted your most sensitive information and that can plug in just like it was here in your app settings dot Json and in fact, it will look at multiple locations.\n",
      "It will select the highest Priority One that finds so you can have your absence dot Json to your local development, but then have your a jerky volt override that automatically in production even Dev or staging so really at the next level also, this is Json very easy to write.\n",
      "It is just been cosmetic changes the dependencies.\n",
      "Weve moved to that things others rooms.\n",
      "Next we have a three four controllers models and views which we have models and views as well, but thing has our spurs things as well, for example content fonts scripts and of course that is the playback.\n",
      "So that is where can it is a little up here input those things like fonts they were growing in the root folder because our static files so kind clean of it break it down to a stand what is going out of we got three folders controller models views makes a little more sense.\n",
      "Tell that net framework not really is pretty close the same thing as what you will find in dot framework.\n",
      "So there is not a lot changes as far as you can jump breaking it down net core and most stuff is just gonna work the same way that is a deal now let us look add a layout page.\n",
      "So there is not a lot changed as far as you can jump right in a.net core and most the stuff is just going to work the same way.\n",
      "As our full framework application is dependent on all these references.\n",
      "This dww rudes is where we store our static files things like our CSS or JavaScript even static HTML Pages can go in here.\n",
      "We do not have that type of thing in our MVC application.\n",
      "It lives right in the the main folder.\n",
      "It is a little difference a little bit more separation better understanding of what goes where.\n",
      "As our full framework application is dependent on all these references.\n",
      "So it is the same concept you have to better name as a better group as well okay we come down to core we have you we do not have a that down here in a full framework.\n",
      "If will restore our static files things like our CSS Javascript is even static html pages can go in here we have that kind of thing that our application.\n",
      "This is where we store all of our configurations.\n",
      "This is just one type of configuration option for dot Corp in fact, it is not the configuration option.\n",
      "So the next level also this is JSon very easy to write.\n",
      "They recommend for things like and connections strings and I connections strings reason they give three of now for it went the huge healthy control the web server but something they can consider well with core applications.\n",
      "Let is look at the layout page.\n",
      "So for example this the icon for our website lives inside www route, but down here in MVC.\n",
      "So for example, this the icon for our website live inside route, but down here it is right in the the main folder.\n",
      "But we are not to get some more concrete detail here a minute for example, we have app not Json.\n",
      "There is a stack of different options for example, Azure which even as they are very to and stored and encrypted your most sensitive animation and then can point in just like you was hearing or not selling that Json in fact it will look at multiple locations and based on your priority will select those highest one that finds so how you are absent such chase on your local development but then have your Azure override that in production even or staging.\n",
      "For example, if attention or database going here possibly but and this is where a S p dot met he socket at core in general had takes a next level compared to the full framework.\n",
      "So is pretty much the same thing as our full framework about their about down views about okay so they can show it with almost of the same the code is fairly similar.\n",
      "He is pretty close to the same thing as what you will find in dotnet framework.\n",
      "The analog of this is the web.config much more stuff here and it is XML harder right too hard to read hard to create systems that actually work the way you expect them to so definitely an upgrade their also web config does not have great.\n",
      "So that is kind of a downside of dotnet framework.\n",
      "Tell that is dotnet core not dotnet framework.\n",
      "I am not going to go to Azure when I have got the web.config.\n",
      "This data route.\n",

      "It is a little difference a little bit more separation that understanding how what those.\n",
      "So now let us actually look at what the code behind controllers look like the control is how runs an application here is our full framework controller pretty standard of course it pretty much empty well let us go to our controller and dot it also looks pretty standard in fact the differences are minor we still average view initial main thing and then agreeing the new need to match that thing some privacy I you because we had a privacy method.\n",
      "The views so look at that privacy view.\n",
      "The along is the much more stuff here and its are to hard hard to create systems that actually work the way you expect them to so definitely an upgrade there also when thing does not have late ways of it does have some ways does transformed and like that did not do are you much just saying if you are look the web eight all azure went on the web phase so that is kind of it down the framework.\n",
      "Ways of overriding it does have some ways there is config transforms and things like that you can do but it pretty much just saying if you are looking for the web.config, I am always looking fake.\n",

      "That is a bad deal for you.\n",
      "So if you your yourself back and forty which is real easy because that is just matter of not doing as well that he dont know when you fail and people might say well I really do not want to know when I think because that is painful so I will keep myself lined about when I fail that is fine except you fail all the time then you just will not know it until you failed that that you got and that can easily happen by the time you are forty so I would recommend that you do not let that happen.\n",
      "It is not a bloody presence.\n",
      "So and you need to know what you damn is worth one of the things you should be asking yourself is would you spend an hour with this all have I paid someone fifty bucks to have had that hour an answer is no, it is like well mean you should do something else with your time and depends on whether I can that your time were not for but the funny thing about not asuming that is if you asume your find in while what happens is you do not just sit around randomly in the stage of responsibility with less when we do is to operate eventually and consult that seems like a statement solution.\n",
      "Then you do not know when you fail and people might say well, I really do not want to know when I fail because that is painful.\n",
      "You know those are that is what life is about and if you do not have any of those things well you have got left is and suffering.\n",
      "Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I will work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes.\n",
      "I do not know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you are negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that is how you make the schedule it is like and then you think well if I have that day that I would be good great you know and you are useless and so you are probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you are going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you would like to have.\n",
      "It is bad.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it is more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what is the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him.\n",
      "Then you just will not know it until you failed so badly that you are done and that can easily happen by the time you are XnumberX.So I would recommend that you do not let that happen.\n",
      "The goal is to have a vision for your life such that all things considered that justifies your effort.\n",

      "So what is the rule with the schedule?\n",
      "So I do not like that follow a schedules.\n",
      "So it is like well, what kind of schedule are you setting up?\n",
      "It is like raw set the damn schedule up so that you have.\n",
      "So that is that is a bad that is a bad deal for you so number specify by your because how are going hit something if you do not know what it is is that is not going to happen and often be specify their goal too because they do not like to specify conditions for failure.\n",
      "So you known like you chose us not to okay so once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this like looks like that might be worth than having despite the fact that it is going to be you know exciting promote and threatening and there is going to be some suffering and loss involved at all of that obviously the goal is have a vision for your life such that all things considered not just advise your efforts.\n",
      "Well this is what I aiming for how does that understand itself day day we do we month a month and that is where something like the schedule can be unbelievable is a Google calendar.\n",
      "It is like native day schedule and stick to it.\n",
      "Okay so what is the rule with the schedule.\n",
      "There you want that is the trick it is like okay I got tomorrow if I was going to set up so the best possible day.\n",
      "I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there is a bit responsibility that is going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you are going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you are not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that is a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it is like sorry, that is just not a good strategy.\n",
      "So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay?\n",
      "And that is hard for people because they do not like themselves very much they are always like back in the web and then procrastinating and cracking the way them procrastinating against like so such a way is spending your time and you know what that is like because you probably wait like six hours a day what you do now is going to it is in the future.\n",
      "Okay you do then they he turn down to the micro it is like okay?\n",
      "That is the first thing that people do wrong is well I do not like how all let us schedules was like what kind of schedule are you are setting up well I have to do this.\n",
      "Then I have to do this and I have to do this you know and then I just go play video because we wants to do all these things that I have to do like said schedule.\n",
      "So that is that is a bad.\n",
      "So to speak someone that you have to negotiate with and you someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a those life too.\n",
      "And you do that by referring to social norms that is more less you your father from the value of the way, but the way the other are way you do that is how a conversation with yourself about if you do not really know who you are are because you know what you are like you will not do you are told you will not do what you tell yourself to do you must have noticed that it is like you are a bad employee and a worse loss and going into those for you you do not know what you want to do and then when you tell yourself what do you do not do it anyway but you know my point that you have to understand that you are not your own servant.\n",
      "So number one specify your damn golf because how are you going to hit something?\n",
      "If you do not know what it is that is not going to happen and often people will specify their goals to because they do not like to specify conditions for failure.\n",
      "So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that is just a matter of not doing as well.\n",
      "So I will keep myself blind about when I fail that is fine, except you will fail all the time.\n",
      "So once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this life looks like that might be worth living despite the fact that it is going to be, you know, anxiety provoking and threatening and there is going to be some suffering and loss involved in all of that.\n",
      "Well, then then you turn down to the micro routines like, okay.\n",
      "How does that instantiate itself day to day week to week month to month?\n",
      "It is not a bloody prison.That is the first thing that people do wrong.\n",
      "Well, I I have to do this then I have to do this and I have to do this, you know, and then I just go play video games because who wants to do all these things that I have to do.\n",

Yes, it does and that's why there's some crossover some gray area in these but UI design is more closely related to the visual communication Arts like graphic design as in picking colors and typography and making things really beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at job. As for UI designer the responsibilities that you'll find there are more related to graphic design to web design to maybe even branding design and also at times front end development because having a good understanding of code. Can you?.  It's design is okay. It'll cost for your nowadays.

Unlike the network D M s our d m does now support many to many relationships relational usually have pre data that they can support. This is the most popular type in the market examples of relational database management systems include and Microsoft server object oriented relational t m.

That's a bad deal for you. So number one specify your damn golf because how are you going to hit something? If you don't know what it is that isn't going to happen and often people will specify their goals to because they don't like to specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well. Then you don't know when you fail and people might say well, I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful. So I'll keep myself blind about when I fail that's fine, except you'll fail all the time. Then you just won't know it until you failed so badly that you're done and that can easily happen by the time you're 40.So I would recommend that you don't let that happen. So that's willful blindness, right? You could have known but you chose not to okay. So once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this life looks like that might be worth living despite the fact that it's going to be, you know, anxiety provoking and threatening and there's going to be some suffering and loss involved in all of that. Obviously. The goal is to have a vision for your life such that all things considered that justifies your effort. Okay. So then what do you do? Well, then then you turn down to the micro routines like, okay. Well, this is what I'm aiming for. How does that instantiate itself day to day week to week month to month? And that's where something like a schedule can be unbelievably useful Google Calendar. It's like naked a schedule and stick to it. Okay. So what's the rule with the schedule? It's not a bloody prison.That's the first thing that people do wrong. So I don't like that follow a schedules. So it's like well, what kind of schedule are you setting up? Well, I I have to do this then I have to do this and I have to do this, you know, and then I just go play video games because who wants to do all these things that I have to do.

It's like native day schedule and stick to it. Okay so what's the rule with the schedule. It's not a bloody presence. That's the first thing that people do wrong is well I don't like how all let's schedules was like what kind of schedule are you're setting up well I have to do this.

      "There you want that's the trick it's like okay I got tomorrow if I was going to set up so the best possible day. I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit responsibility that's going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you're going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you're not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that's a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it's like sorry, that's just not a good strategy. It's bad. So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it's more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what's the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him. So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I'll work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I don't know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that's how you make the schedule it's like and then you think well if I have that day that I'd be good great you know and you're useless and so you're probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you'd like to have.\n",
      "And you do that by referring to social norms that's more less you your father from the value of the way, but the way the other are way you do that is how a conversation with yourself about if you don't really know who you are are because you know what you're like you won't do you're told you won't do what you tell yourself to do you must have noticed that it's like you're a bad employee and a worse loss and going into those for you you don't know what you want to do and then when you tell yourself what do you don't do it anyway but you know my point that you have to understand that you're not your own servant. So to speak someone that you have to negotiate with and you someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a those life too. And that's hard for people because they don't like themselves very much they're always like back in the web and then procrastinating and cracking the way them procrastinating against like so such a way is spending your time and you know what that's like because you probably wait like six hours a day what you do now is going to it's in the future. So and you need to know what you damn is worth one of the things you should be asking yourself is would you spend an hour with this all have I paid someone fifty bucks to have had that hour an answer is no, it's like well mean you should do something else with your time and depends on whether I can that your time weren't for but the funny thing about not a*suming that is if you a*sume your find in while what happens is you don't just sit around randomly in the stage of responsibility with less when we do is to operate eventually and consult that seems like a statement solution.\n",

But in this is where asp.net and.net core in general kind of takes it to the next level compared to the full framework. This is just one type of configuration option for dotnet court. And in fact, it's not the configuration option. They recommend for things like connection strings. Everyone's concern on connection strings for good reason they give away the security or database. Now for a web application not a huge deal to control the web server, but it doesn't they can consider it of well with core applications. There's a stack of different options. For example, as your key volts, which is an Azure. It's very very cheap and stored securely encrypted your most sensitive information and that can plug in just like it was here in your app settings dot Json and in fact, it will look at multiple locations. And based upon your priority. It will select the highest Priority One that finds so you can have your absence dot Json to your local development, but then have your a jerky volt override that automatically in production even Dev or staging so really at the next level also, this is Json very easy to write.\n",

Although we use a below of those basics client principles which I just love and think are just the investing in so as long important basic design principles. You can kind of transition them over to you either. So there is the difference thing between you and UX design some overlap a little bit of similarities, but very very different. What of that being more than more alytical the other one being more visual problem solving seventy driven.\n",

That's a bad deal for you. So number one specify your damn golf because how are you going to hit something? If you don't know what it is that isn't going to happen and often people will specify their goals to because they don't like to specify conditions for failure. So if you keep yourself all vague and foggy, which is real easy because that's just a matter of not doing as well. Then you don't know when you fail and people might say well, I really don't want to know when I fail because that's painful. So I'll keep myself blind about when I fail that's fine, except you'll fail all the time. Then you just won't know it until you failed so badly that you're done and that can easily happen by the time you're 40.So I would recommend that you don't let that happen. So that's willful blindness, right? You could have known but you chose not to okay. So once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this life looks like that might be worth living despite the fact that it's going to be, you know, anxiety provoking and threatening and there's going to be some suffering and loss involved in all of that. Obviously. The goal is to have a vision for your life such that all things considered that justifies your effort. Okay. So then what do you do? Well, then then you turn down to the micro routines like, okay. Well, this is what I'm aiming for. How does that instantiate itself day to day week to week month to month? And that's where something like a schedule can be unbelievably useful Google Calendar. It's like naked a schedule and stick to it. Okay. So what's the rule with the schedule? It's not a bloody prison.That's the first thing that people do wrong. So I don't like that follow a schedules. So it's like well, what kind of schedule are you setting up? Well, I I have to do this then I have to do this and I have to do this, you know, and then I just go play video games because who wants to do all these things that I have to do.

      "There you want that's the trick it's like okay I got tomorrow if I was going to set up so the best possible day. I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit responsibility that's going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you're going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you're not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that's a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it's like sorry, that's just not a good strategy. It's bad. So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it's more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what's the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him. So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I'll work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I don't know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that's how you make the schedule it's like and then you think well if I have that day that I'd be good great you know and you're useless and so you're probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you'd like to have.\n",

So to speak someone that you have to negotiate with and you someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a those life too. And that's hard for people because they don't like themselves very much they're always like back in the web and then procrastinating and cracking the way them procrastinating against like so such a way is spending your time and you know what that's like because you probably wait like six hours a day what you do now is going to it's in the future. So and you need to know what you damn is worth one of the things you should be asking yourself is would you spend an hour with this all have I paid someone fifty bucks to have had that hour an answer is no, it's like well mean you should do something else with your time and depends on whether I can that your time weren't for but the funny thing about not a*suming that is if you a*sume your find in while what happens is you don't just sit around randomly in the stage of responsibility with less when we do is to operate eventually and consult that seems like a statement solution.\n",

For example, as your key volts, which is an Azure. It's very very cheap and stored securely encrypted your most sensitive information and that can plug in just like it was here in your app settings dot Json and in fact, it will look at multiple locations.

Were user experience design is all about user experiencing the product and having a delightful interaction with it. User interface design is its visual animals cousin so to speak it is all about the look and feel and the interaction and the presentation of the product itself and some of you might be saying does not that helped me have a better user experience. Yes, it does and that is why there is some crossover some gray area in these but UI design is more closely related to the visual communication Arts like graphic design as in picking colors and typography and making things really beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at job. As for UI designer the responsibilities that you will find there are more related to graphic design to web design to maybe even branding design and also at times front end development because having a good understanding of code. It is design is okay. Itll cost for your nowadays. Although there is such a thing as their face designers for things like cockpits and side of airplanes and you know, all that kind of stuff, but mostly it is you know used in Under the Umbrella of digital stuff nowadays, like websites and products a UI designers purpose is to receive. \n",

So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I'll work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I don't know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that's how you make the schedule it's like and then you think well if I have that day that I'd be good great you know and you're useless and so you're probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you'd like to have.\n",

So and you need to know what you damn is worth one of the things you should be asking yourself is would you spend an hour with this all have I paid someone fifty bucks to have had that hour an answer is no, it's like well mean you should do something else with your time and depends on whether I can that your time weren't for but the funny thing about not a*suming that is if you a*sume your find in while what happens is you don't just sit around randomly in the stage of responsibility with less when we do is to operate eventually and consult that seems like a statement solution.\n",

It's very very cheap and stored securely encrypted your most sensitive information and that can plug in just like it was here in your app settings dot Json and in fact, it will look at multiple locations.

Yes, it does and that's why there's some crossover some gray area in these but UI design is more closely related to the visual communication Arts like graphic design as in picking colors and typography and making things really beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at job. As for UI designer the responsibilities that you'll find there are more related to graphic design to web design to maybe even branding design and also at times front end development because having a good understanding of code. Can you?.  It's design is okay. It'll cost for your nowadays.

Now what is a database we already know what data is, but this day that could be random a database is a collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy. What is a database management system database management system or is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access the database up data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people own numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a gave to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data cetera. Let's consider the Facebook. It needs to store everything and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertis***nts and a lot more. We can provide help numbers of examples for usage of database management systems are not a new concept and it's such had been first us implemented in the April charles.",

It's bad. So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it's more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what's the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him. So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I'll work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I don't know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that's how you make the schedule it's like and then you think well if I have that day that I'd be good great you know and you're useless and so you're probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you'd like to have.",

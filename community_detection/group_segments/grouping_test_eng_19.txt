I'm working on creating the deployment package for that. Once it is ready. I'll sit with Tricia intermittent and plan to deploy it in the staging to and it's currently it's currently it's it's it can detect with with fairly decent accuracy which means true positives are higher which means that for all the things that it detects 80% of them can definitely be take this action items. But on the other side, there are like 30 to 40% action items that are getting missed but based on the feedback and based on a lot of testing with I think.Can continue to work on improving that so I have tested it on a previous engineering conversations as well as podcasts and obviously needless to say it is directly the qualities directly proportional to the transcript quality. Even Even in our engineering calls. It is able to pick up a few action items which are which at least have a it mean it's not very sensitive to language. But if the language is in their speech to text is good. I think it is it is picking up. Well, I think I'll talk I'll work on deploying it and at the latest by Monday we should have it in Beijing to provided on the platform side. We don't have any additional apartment because it's already it's already tagged. We already captured action items regular expression. So we need not have anything.",

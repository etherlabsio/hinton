But let's start maybe at the beginning you guys do work with Federal government usually through value added sellers and other partners, but it's still good time for even if you are vendors like yourself to be in the Federal market tell me why is good time to be a government vendor. The Federal market has always been a very important market for secure, but also for other major security. When is the Federal government and the federal sector generally tends to be a pioneer in many cases and a early adapter of security solutions. Obviously there's a lot of challenges that are being faced by the and broadly speaking the commercial sector as well be it related to the increase of the types and the depth and the complexity of the threats that they're are facing what I would call inside a challenges, meaning the separation of the Federal enterprise itself from outside and an inside perspective leading to the thrust around leader trust which again, the government has been a big prominent off and then the adoption of mobile technologies and cloud for instance.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"Have increased the challenges as it relates to visibility and ensuring compliance in the broader sector but specifically in the federal sector as well all of these challenges and problems. Obviously result in the ability for somebody like us to solve these problems and in that in that context of fairly government and the federal sector is a very large opportunity for us. Now it's interesting you say that the government has maybe been an early adopter sometimes security companies and other technology companies. We'll say the Government's always a step behind because they are risk of diverse. They don't wanna have failure. So they wanna adopt something they know is security a little different based on the breaches. We've seen whether it's the V bridge from two thousand six the opium reach from twenty fifteen that is pushed them to be more of on the front end of security and has pushed them into the into the forefront of security. I would say and because as you know even at the National Government level at the Congress level security in various forms. Sometimes these are international threat. So to speak or the general standard security for information protection access capabilities, etcetera are all relevant the fairly government also has to be very efficient in terms of delivering and adopting new technologies like cloud and hybrid as an example or even mobile technologies. So the locking down of the areas and creating wall. The gardens is no longer practical even in the federal sector. And so the way I think about it is when people say they are risk recovers the way have a describe it is that they are risk aware as opposed to risk and in the context of being risked aware if they can be diligent intelligent about who the security providers are and ensure that they are going through the right integrations etc then the speed of delivery and deployment increases and.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"Happening in the Security Marketplace. The rise of ransom. We talked a little bit about zero trust where is this security market though going. We're broadly you know if we have this conversation again in a year or two what's going to change about the security market specifically for the federal agencies. We spoke about feed trust happening or coming up in conversations on a more frequent basis. The way I would describe it is in the next two to three years zero trust will become much more of a prevalent deployment model in the Federal sector as well as in the commercial sector, but clearly in the subtle sector for all the reasons that we discussed two is that some of the call it the traditional requirements because networks are not gonna go away right away. So some of the traditional requirements, including things like a to dot one x take requirements etcetera will continue to evolve and a*sociated with that is end endpoint security and compliance even basic things like while I provide freedom to my end users to use any mobile device that they want. I need to have capabilities to ensure that the device is not J and so point compliance the endpoint security will be another key requirement and will become an ongoing and increasing requirement in the federal sector. We spoke about iot o t that I believe will be a very important requirement both from a visibility standpoint as well as what we would call it enforcement. So once you know what is connecting you want to take the mediation actions so that becomes an important element as well. So in that context partnerships with channel partners integrate everyone becomes critical because budgets and freedom dictated better integration more simplicity. So simplicity will be a very key trend and a requirement as well in the federal sector and last but not least continue to build.\"\n",

I am very optimistic that the federal sector will catch on to some of the business model friends in the commercial space. Some of the ones that we discussed including subscription, including P as you go p s etcetera and all of this will need to be wrapped up in a or and automation framework providing better a**lytics and therefore better visibility to our customers. So these are some of the key requirements that we see emerging more and more and more in the federal sector and they will happen in various agencies at different speeds. But everybody seems to be trending in the same direction. It's interesting you brought up a better data a**lytics and I think that's the key thing that I see when I talked to all the time is a desire for more information but also the ability to understand and process that information do you have that problem as a security vendor where you gotta be how do you find that right balance between not just over overloading your customers with security information but helping them understand what with what it all means definitely json and I like to distinguish between information which is a slip call reporting. So and so data points or this is what happened etcetera versus insights and our focus on a**lytics is much more on the insights of hey, this is what's happening. This is what could happen and this is what you must do to protect against anything bad from happening. So while there is still a lot of value to basic reporting increasingly because of the amount of information that is being given to everyone it is more critical to move towards providing insights to our customers and that's our focus as it leads to a**lytics you brought up the fact that you guys don't sell necessarily directly to the government you worked through third party value sellers other partners talk about what the challenge.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"That brings for a Vendor who's trying to sell to the government cause that's maybe much different than how you sell the commercial world in many ways they send it this similar to how we sell into the commercial world. Although there are significant differences. So as I previously mentioned we go to a tax with our customers and indirectly development. So that's no different in the federal sector as well one of the advantages pages. Let me start with the positives of working with partners aggregate as contact this they add a lot of value to us in terms of the requirements of the federal sector meaning that they have many more feet on the street. They yeah, there a lot more intelligent so to speak and they're able to give it back to us such that we're able to build solutions that matter more to the federal sector. So that's a very important a benefit that we derived from our partner community. If you want to highlight of what could happen in the flip side the flip side is that we don't really have a awareness of visibility of everything that goes on at the end customer and sometimes we get slow down. Let's say by other vendors who might be in the process or call it the bureaucracy of the system. Sometimes and so in this particular case at least so far the positives is the negatives for us and we can take to work on how we make our relationships more efficient broader deeper etc and if anything we are trying to expand a network of partners and then we as needed can always go to our end customers and learn directly directly from them as well is that a challenge that if you call up if you have a contract with somebody and a lot of times the agency will say we only want to do with the prime do you use that a problem for you guys then they say well if we need to talk to somebody and at the agency level we have to go through our primary contract.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"Or a partner or can you call them directly again typically that's similarly never been an issue for us because what happens in most cases is that even if any agency says they want to engage with the crime. So to speak as you highlighted the contract that we'll want take us as a subject metrics, but in many cases to the agencies that's number one number two is that over the years through a combination of a solution sprint as well as our focus on their success. We have direct access to them as well. So very I can't honestly a instance where that has been a problem for us that's good news because a lot of times that's it's more likely for small businesses we hear this. But where the prime is is so territorial. They don't wanna bring anyone else in except for the prime contract. Obviously it's it maybe different for bar or or for for a bigger company like yourself the other challenges that yeah, the other challenges with ours is some of the flow requirements you have to deal with some of the procurement and other footer requirements that or is that you deal with that anyways I guess just where I'm looking for is does does you not selling directly to the government put any extra burden or compliance issues on your shoulders that you wouldn't normally have not necessarily Json. I mean we have a relationship with the aggregate as like D solutions and makes and so our contracts are very very clear with them and then they kind of value add on the other side by either supporting us or shielding us from the idiosyncrasies of their specific relationships with the agency. So in that regard. There's actually a benefit to working with with partners, but from time to time there are acceptance in criteria etcetera that I pa*sed through. But that's completely fine because we own the entire very good almost had a time for let you go. I just want to bring up one another pieces of.\"\n",

There's a big push for these innovative companies and we need to bring in all these commercial companies or that have never done business with the government and learn from them and you we've seen approaches like other transaction authorities or other transaction agreements does this what's your take on that because as you told at the very beginning and in many ways the government can can be ahead of the commercial or at least even at the commercial world where do you see this kind of balance or or this need for the the innovative company coming from or or how how's that kind of flowing down to you guys we do see the benefit of that sentiment or that requirement Jason. The way I would highlight it is that there is a meaningful call responsibility on part of all of his young or mature companies to truly understand the sector to understand your customers. So to speak right? So while you may have the other transactional priorities except etcetera. It does not remove the responsibility on the vendors to actually understand the federal factor and try to work towards satisfying and those customers in other words understand what problems are solving under understand how we will be beneficial to the fairly sector and areas such as the etcetera are call a means to an end not an end itself. So to speak. So as long as the vendors is are focused on what is the desired outcome they should be fine and on the on the left side the failure continuing to call it cross with the commercial factor. They will also allow things to be sped up in terms of adoption of latest technologies understanding of latest solutions and then obviously improving their security pastures reducing.\"\n",

So those are the two key I would say the Federal is looking for us as when is that's one reason why we work with integrations and others to deliver complete. I'm am a little surprised you didn't say the budget so many people when I ask the same first question every time know is at a good time to be a federal contractor everyone says well, we have budget uncertainty or the fact is we know the budget looks like or just got a budget deal done that that affects you a lot less than maybe a more quote traditional government contractor doesn't it in many respects. Yes, although even as a vendor we would like for better predictability on the budget and the speeding up of the budget process and the allocation to them as well because we work with other bags and larger freddy contact and the degree that they are impacted we get impacted as well, the and the significance of the benefit like we to the table is we are a very diversified business. So while the federal set is a very important factor for us as a vendor. We have a very large commercial presence as well and we always trying to call it cross meaning the trends and the technologies that we've built for a commercial sector. We try to see how they can apply to the fairly sector. And to the degree that we learn about things in the federal sector. We try to take them back to the commercial sector. So in many ways we tend to be unique in that respect and so to your point about budgets etcetera we are able to diverse higher our business because of our presence in more than eighty percent of the fortune five hundred for instance that allows us to take things into the federal sector and vice versa you bring up trends and I think that's a great segue way to the next question because what are some of the trends you are seeing whether from the commercial to the federal or vice versa as you know is a very fascinating.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"And especially in the Security space. The friends are evolving. I would say even faster than many other sectors lemme highlight a few and happy to elaborate on some as you please first one I would say is the security challenges that customers are facing. Let's start with the commercial factor are increasing at rates that has never been seen before that is further complicated i would say in many ways by the demand from the customers customers for more freedom and less control meaning that I want to be using a device wherever I am located I want you to move my applications to the cloud i want you to deploy a hybrid policy etcetera effort some of it is economics some of it is user experience some of it is simply user preference and all those things what happens is that it complicates security policy. It makes it more difficult for companies to ensure that their security posture is proper and protected. So that's one key aspect but the other side of the point is that companies have fewer resources to deploy and make useful these solutions. So on one hand the number of security solutions is growing on the other hand customers have fewer people and fewer resources to manage all this so the implication from a vendor community standpoint is make things incredibly easy to use make things more integrated don't make your customers environment your test labs. I mean those are all things that we subscribe to very deeply and strive to support customers and make their lives simpler as so speak that's that's one keeping two is with the advent of call the broadly seeking the internet of things more and more things are getting.\"\n",

What should we allowed to etcetera etcetera and so that has got a lot of people thinking and worrying about what the unknown service that results in if all these things are happening. Am I compliant whether it is to my internal audit needs or external audit needs to compliant becomes a bigger and bigger issue that everybody has to to worry about so these combined with the economic challenges you mentioned budget in the federal the budgets in the commercial sector always tend to be quite tight as well and so what does cloud mean can I use the cloud and save dollars become more efficient as an example, so that at the same time increases complexity from a security sample. So these are some of the broader trends that are happening. And I think the important thing from event community standpoint is make things more simple even as you keep them secure to enable to manage these things better and give customers option don't force them into the cloud or don't save them into a data center adopt hybrid approaches and give seamless access to those custom couple interesting things I want pull the let me start with obviously the increasing number of threats. We've seen that for last year know five or ten years but the the freedom side and I think that something that the government the federal government is just starting to come to grips with that and you're seeing a big push for or citizen services user experience and things like that how did you as a security vendor kind of listen to what the government is saying and take you that into account as you're developing products and solutions freedom in this particular context comes on two fronts.\"\n",

Yeah one of the prominent agencies is actually part of our to council and more recently actually in me of this year we hosted a customer council which included them and other commercial customers is well we do that routinely to essentially cross best practices between commercial and Federal there we went through our zero trust solutions. Not zero test plans so to speak and simply put in the approach that we take we and authenticate users which is the ident*ty problem that you highlighted devices to ensure that the devices that are connecting compliant and have the right security posture etcetera, etcetera applications to make sure that applications are authorized to be delivered in a certain way and used by the users and last but not least the networks. So users devices applications and networks are all authorized and provided access by our solutions. The combination of those will allow a customer to deploy a zero trust environment. So the more we are able to educate them in those terms and language that they already know they're getting more and more comfortable with greater trust and obviously they derive the benefits of zero trust by not having wall. The gardens and not having different security policies for inside and outside. So we've taken that approach and while the adoption in the commercial sector has been faster. I will say that the conversations and the federal sector are also accelerating do you get a sense that the reason why the conversations are accelerating is because of the technology model you mentioned earlier. How much is changing.\"\n",

I also think to a large degree it is the obligation of vendors such ourselves to be able to articulate these things simply to the federal factor and others and highlight how we are adding value to them rather than pushing a specific product or a point solution to them in other words if we work backwards from this concept which we define entirely customer success and doing what's right and solving their problems, including integrating with third party Vendors. We will be able to accelerate the their journey and so it's a combination of really solving the problem and then mapping it on to their particular problems and environments are there other pieces of that technology model or the or the or the business model that you're seeing that they're starting to really change as you spend more time in the federal market. So as you think about the business models themselves increasingly. I feel that is a greater awareness of business models like subscription for instance, even in the federal sector, which I will not have said a few years ago but I think this is a bleed so to speak from the commercial factor into the Federal factor where more and more customers again, either budget constrained or not thinking about subscription based models as well as agencies that offer services to other agencies thinking about pay as pay pro type models as well that requires both the aggregate and contractors is to adapt and adopt new business models which then obviously translates to us as well on our side because of the fact that we've done all of this on the commercial sector.

The freedom that we are trying to enable for them is how do I kinda of create investment protection for what you've already bought while you stand into new deployment. Let's say in the cloud as an example, how do I give you freedom to adopt applications that are modern than that may be delivered from the cloud without compromising what you have built over the years in your data centers how do I policies security practices are consistent between the cloud and the data center. So that's broadly called hybrid. I or hybrid security in this particular context. So that's a level of freedom we need to provide to everybody including the federal sector because that's becoming an increasingly important requirement. Obviously there's an economic dimension to budget. I dimension to it as well on the other side I would call them end users requiring freedom and that could be be it use my mobile device be it use my system from anywhere be it local be remote in another country without compromising my security posture and giving me freedom to be productive freedom. Essentially equates to simplicity which then allows you to more productive what we have done is on the end user side we have client software that is identical across all platforms. So whether you take windows mac linux etc. What we ensure is that the user experience and all of those platforms is identical.

They wanna use then obviously there is the integration into the platform itself where they don't feel like they're using separate and new technology. So in other words what we have done is on all operating systems we have a approach which we call a workspace in fact, many customers in the Federal sector use this particular product which allows it and user to use any device or their choosing but as long as they have the workspace because the workspace is protected. So you're separating always the person from the business that also is an option that we give to the federal sector where they able to not have to procure a lot more devices then they absolutely need to and then worry about how they lock them down so that's another form of freedom that both types of freedom that we just discussed let's take a quick break when come back we can jump into some of those other things you talked about in terms of trends.

So I when I wake up generally try to touch base with the teams in Europe where it's already mid day for instance for them that gives me a head start on what's happening on Europe and a typical drive to the workplace if I'm not traveling to a customer or a partner would involve touching base with the a series of my teammates server whether it be my marketing counterpart my c f o except I just quick touch base on how things are going what happening what needs to be done etcetera etcetera and then one time at work. I like to describe my job as trying to enable others and eliminate roadblocks so to that and I spend a lot of time in. Let's say a budget meeting or planning meeting or sometimes we prepare for our external boards and investors to to call it update them on the health of the business the progress of the business etcetera, but also tried to spend at least thirty percent of my time. If not more with customers and partners and I also tend to spend a lot of time with my employees because at the end of the day if I can have a satisfied employee base i know my customers will be taken care of this is we get to the part of the show this one of my favorite parts because I get to learn something about you.\"\n",

So it's similar to like jeopardy and others, but it's not as structured and it was much more free flowing we used to enjoy that a lot because there was a certain camaraderie alternate and a certain level of creativity and exploration involved in it. So that is something that I don't think a lot of people know about me. So did you ever go out for jeopardy. No not not for jeopardy here not not yet at least right not yet yet that least yes. That's a more optimistic and and was there a part of the trivial issue that you were special specialized in were you more about geography versus something else who knows I was more focused than history and sports so both and history.

    "\t\t\t\t\"This generally ask a customer how many devices do you think are at any point in time connected to your network who was connecting and connecting to your network and oftentimes. Let's say they come up with an answer like five thousand and within a few weeks of running some software and identifying what's getting connected to them we t find that they're off by a factor of two or three and in some cases in factor of ten in many cases. So what happens is that that really creates a aha moment for them saying I if I don't even know what's trying to connect to my network how will I ever be able to protect it and that is really the visibility challenge and that's greatly exacerbated by the the whole I o t trend or as you said connected internet where on one hand. I say it is very good and very productive for all of these devices to be connected to the internet. Why simply because it makes administrators life in terms of understanding various forms of connections connectivity and usage that much more simpler, but with that kind of freedom comes the complexity of what is the security capabilities of these devices they're running the right types of software how can I attach policy to that all those things become very important. And that's where the first step is to understand what is being connected to the network and then a**lyze the visibility challenge and again, this has become a very top of my topic for both commercial as well as the Federal factor. I know in the Federal sector. They're using the continuous diagnostics and mitigation or C p m program and and that has played a big role and understanding me what's on agencies networks at the same time know to secure those devices they may know that they're there.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"Think that that leaves us down the path of another kind of related trend which is why zero trust is getting so much attention in the federal market and and I know you guys are in the zero trust world too. But let's walk me through a little bit zero trust we know that umbrella. It's a framework. It's not aiming one technology, but what are you seen from when you talk to agency about zero trust and it is becoming increasingly at top of mind topic traditional way of looking at security was you had an enterprise boundary or a parameter call it a wall garden every bit of traffic that comes from outside the enterprise per was deemed unsafe for by definition and therefore had to be protected and authorized on the everything that was inside the parameter was deemed secure and should have free access increasingly what's happening and this happened a lot more in the commercial factor is that more and more threat starting from inside the network and think of a very simple case I'm working on my computer at home. I get infected by something happening on the internet. I come inside the network parameter meaning inside my office. I'll open up my laptop and I have the danger of interacting the entire system. So that's becoming increasingly prevalent and there are many more sophisticated ways of doing that, but I'm giving you a very basic example that is leading to this notion of hey, I icon. I can't trust traffic coming from the outside nor should I trust anything that inside leading to the concept of zero trust while on one hand everybody's beginning to be aligned on trust. What it also creates is what is the best way most economical way and simply put the most secure way of addressing this zero trust challenge and that's what when is like us and others.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"Are attempting thing to do both for the commercial sector as well as the federal factor. When you talk to your federal clients when you work with your your partners is you ever trust one of those things that just comes up constantly or is it something that's maybe more that that just starting to come up now or last six months. I would say it is increasingly coming up Jason and I would say the number of asks or mentions is actually accelerating is bit probably the best way to categorize it and at the same time though nobody's really doing zero trust at least from my perspective the people I've talked to I think a lot of people are are just talking about it. You is that something near seeing or do you you actually see the pieces being put in place to create that zero trust environment. I would actually humbly submit that we and some others are actually addressing zero trust in a very comprehensive way rights on the get go and increasingly as our portfolio use continue to evolve this support the freedom requirement that we spoke about both for administrators and end users of what we're really doing now is mapping what we do through the concept of zero trust. So in other words. This is not a case of a new concept coming up and then everybody catching up to it. We are all figuring out how to reinforce and rename size what we do in the zero trust framework. So in that trigger regard i would say the solution from us and some others are actually closer to customer needs then simply a concept that's interesting because you hear so much to talk about it and never says well there's the the ident*ty management piece and then there's the you know hardware a*set so for us that management piece and these kind of all these pieces and parts that fit on the umbrella, but that's good to hear that you know it's it's it's almost like the the message from Vendors like yourselves is that hey, the pieces are there you just as agency maybe just have to put them.\"\n",

I'm your host Jason my guest is Krishna the CEO post no see before break we're talking about the transition and some of the the difference between being a a vendor and the marketplace versus a contractor. So let's get into little more deep depth about what whole here is you role in the federal market and as well as your role as CEO talk a little bit about your company S c e o obviously my main focus is customer success as I previously defined regardless of the sector that the customers are in whether be the federal factor or in the commercial sector. We have a strategy within the company of full fulfilling almost everything we sell through our partners partners are a lot of value to customers. They provide direct touch to customers etcetera, but equally we believe in maintaining direct touch and contacts with as many customers as we possibly can almost every agency in the Federal sector is our customer as well granted through our and our partners some of the agencies are actually on our customer council. So we get a direct connection and connectivity with these customers. We're able to have conversations about trends highlight what's happening in the commercial sector learn from them as to their aspirations for their agencies and others and then work with our partners in terms of responding to larger r F p full fulfilling etcetera. So the way I would describe it is we have a direct touch model with the end customer and a indirect full element model with the likes of loyalty solutions and and others walk me through what a typical of you will bid would look like for company like here is vendor versus a contractor you your partners with a a systems integrated do they call you up and say hey we.\"\n",

    "\t\t\t\t\"Partially walk me a little bit just through maybe something that's typical I give you a couple of scenarios that are typical and one is customers has already deployed a solution to both our touch and the partners touch over the years and they're looking at. Let's say expanding slash modernizing right in those cases. It's a much simpler programming model because we are already in the environment and the customers looking to expand it still comes to us through the resource slash aggregate slash contractor, but it's a fairly straightforward. Then so to speak in other cases the contract that might have and a field. Let's call it a hey, the agencies looking for increase then improved visibility. We been asked to respond with specific vendor solutions can you work with us on responding and creating a very comprehensive response to the agency. So that is the other form which is much more elongated at some level but we go through that process as well and in many cases with our partner as well as the agencies need take so those are the two typical models. It's it's rarely something where out of the blue they come to us and say hey do you have something like this. It's interesting. There's the two kind of paths you guys go down on so kind of get in front of the customer and and work with with your partners. How different is that then just bidding on your own did you guys ever think about maybe we would just sell directly to the government or have you always gone down the path of partners and value added resources. We've always gone down the path of partners and value every resources you could say that some degree that comes from a commercial heritage because in the commercial space. We are in every major geography. We have over twenty thousand customers so providing touch to every one of them.\"\n",

      "Welcome to views from the Corner Office a conversation with private sector leaders who influence and impact the federal market views from the corner office delivers of perspective on technology acquisition and leadership issues through the lands of executives who lead the federal practices of government contractors. Now your host Jason Miller. I guess today Krishna. The CEO of Paul's secure. Welcome to the program dates. Thanks for having me. This discussion we're having today is a little different than my normal views from a corner office discussion, usually I have a government contractor, but post here is a government vendor, which is a little different. We'll get into that in a little bit. But let's start maybe at the beginning you guys do work with Federal government usually through value added sellers and other partners, but it's still good time for even if you are vendors like yourself to be in the Federal market tell me why is good time to be a government vendor. The Federal market has always been a very important market for secure, but also for other major security. When is the Federal government and the federal sector generally tends to be a pioneer in many cases and a early adapter of security solutions. Obviously there's a lot of challenges that are being faced by the and broadly speaking the commercial sector as well be it related to the increase of the types and the depth and the complexity of the threats that they're are facing what I would call inside a challenges, meaning the separation of the Federal enterprise itself from outside and an inside perspective leading to the thrust around leader trust which again, the government has been a big prominent off and then the adoption of mobile technologies and cloud for instance. Have increased the challenges as it relates to visibility and ensuring compliance in the broader sector but specifically in the federal sector as well all of these challenges and problems. Obviously result in the ability for somebody like us to solve these problems and in that in that context of fairly government and the federal sector is a very large opportunity for us. Now it's interesting you say that the government has maybe been an early adopter sometimes security companies and other technology companies. We'll say the Government's always a step behind because they are risk of diverse. They don't wanna have failure. So they wanna adopt something they know is security a little different based on the breaches. We've seen whether it's the V bridge from two thousand six the opium reach from twenty fifteen that is pushed them to be more of on the front end of security and has pushed them into the into the forefront of security. I would say and because as you know even at the National Government level at the Congress level security in various forms. Sometimes these are international threat. So to speak or the general standard security for information protection access capabilities, etcetera are all relevant the fairly government also has to be very efficient in terms of delivering and adopting new technologies like cloud and hybrid as an example or even mobile technologies. So the locking down of the areas and creating wall. The gardens is no longer practical even in the federal sector. And so the way I think about it is when people say they are risk recovers the way have a describe it is that they are risk aware as opposed to risk and in the context of being risked aware if they can be diligent intelligent about who the security providers are and ensure that they are going through the right integrations etc then the speed of delivery and deployment increases and.\n",

      "Happening in the Security Marketplace. The rise of ransom. We talked a little bit about zero trust where is this security market though going. We're broadly you know if we have this conversation again in a year or two what's going to change about the security market specifically for the federal agencies. We spoke about feed trust happening or coming up in conversations on a more frequent basis. The way I would describe it is in the next two to three years zero trust will become much more of a prevalent deployment model in the Federal sector as well as in the commercial sector, but clearly in the subtle sector for all the reasons that we discussed two is that some of the call it the traditional requirements because networks are not gonna go away right away. So some of the traditional requirements, including things like a to dot one x take requirements etcetera will continue to evolve and a*sociated with that is end endpoint security and compliance even basic things like while I provide freedom to my end users to use any mobile device that they want. I need to have capabilities to ensure that the device is not J and so point compliance the endpoint security will be another key requirement and will become an ongoing and increasing requirement in the federal sector. We spoke about iot o t that I believe will be a very important requirement both from a visibility standpoint as well as what we would call it enforcement. So once you know what is connecting you want to take the mediation actions so that becomes an important element as well. So in that context partnerships with channel partners integrate everyone becomes critical because budgets and freedom dictated better integration more simplicity. So simplicity will be a very key trend and a requirement as well in the federal sector and last but not least continue to build. Solutions that are hybrid that provide for additional business. I am very optimistic that the federal sector will catch on to some of the business model friends in the commercial space. Some of the ones that we discussed including subscription, including P as you go p s etcetera and all of this will need to be wrapped up in a or and automation framework providing better a**lytics and therefore better visibility to our customers. So these are some of the key requirements that we see emerging more and more and more in the federal sector and they will happen in various agencies at different speeds. But everybody seems to be trending in the same direction. It's interesting you brought up a better data a**lytics and I think that's the key thing that I see when I talked to all the time is a desire for more information but also the ability to understand and process that information do you have that problem as a security vendor where you gotta be how do you find that right balance between not just over overloading your customers with security information but helping them understand what with what it all means definitely json and I like to distinguish between information which is a slip call reporting. So and so data points or this is what happened etcetera versus insights and our focus on a**lytics is much more on the insights of hey, this is what's happening. This is what could happen and this is what you must do to protect against anything bad from happening. So while there is still a lot of value to basic reporting increasingly because of the amount of information that is being given to everyone it is more critical to move towards providing insights to our customers and that's our focus as it leads to a**lytics you brought up the fact that you guys don't sell necessarily directly to the government you worked through third party value sellers other partners talk about what the challenge.\n",

      "\n",
      "That brings for a Vendor who's trying to sell to the government cause that's maybe much different than how you sell the commercial world in many ways they send it this similar to how we sell into the commercial world. Although there are significant differences. So as I previously mentioned we go to a tax with our customers and indirectly development. So that's no different in the federal sector as well one of the advantages pages. Let me start with the positives of working with partners aggregate as contact this they add a lot of value to us in terms of the requirements of the federal sector meaning that they have many more feet on the street. They yeah, there a lot more intelligent so to speak and they're able to give it back to us such that we're able to build solutions that matter more to the federal sector. So that's a very important a benefit that we derived from our partner community. If you want to highlight of what could happen in the flip side the flip side is that we don't really have a awareness of visibility of everything that goes on at the end customer and sometimes we get slow down. Let's say by other vendors who might be in the process or call it the bureaucracy of the system. Sometimes and so in this particular case at least so far the positives is the negatives for us and we can take to work on how we make our relationships more efficient broader deeper etc and if anything we are trying to expand a network of partners and then we as needed can always go to our end customers and learn directly directly from them as well is that a challenge that if you call up if you have a contract with somebody and a lot of times the agency will say we only want to do with the prime do you use that a problem for you guys then they say well if we need to talk to somebody and at the agency level we have to go through our primary contract. Or a partner or can you call them directly again typically that's similarly never been an issue for us because what happens in most cases is that even if any agency says they want to engage with the crime. So to speak as you highlighted the contract that we'll want take us as a subject metrics, but in many cases to the agencies that's number one number two is that over the years through a combination of a solution sprint as well as our focus on their success. We have direct access to them as well. So very I can't honestly a instance where that has been a problem for us that's good news because a lot of times that's it's more likely for small businesses we hear this. But where the prime is is so territorial. They don't wanna bring anyone else in except for the prime contract. Obviously it's it maybe different for bar or or for for a bigger company like yourself the other challenges that yeah, the other challenges with ours is some of the flow requirements you have to deal with some of the procurement and other footer requirements that or is that you deal with that anyways I guess just where I'm looking for is does does you not selling directly to the government put any extra burden or compliance issues on your shoulders that you wouldn't normally have not necessarily Json. I mean we have a relationship with the aggregate as like D solutions and makes and so our contracts are very very clear with them and then they kind of value add on the other side by either supporting us or shielding us from the idiosyncrasies of their specific relationships with the agency. So in that regard. There's actually a benefit to working with with partners, but from time to time there are acceptance in criteria etcetera that I pa*sed through. But that's completely fine because we own the entire very good almost had a time for let you go. I just want to bring up one another pieces of. This especially in the Security world. There's a big push for these innovative companies and we need to bring in all these commercial companies or that have never done business with the government and learn from them and you we've seen approaches like other transaction authorities or other transaction agreements does this what's your take on that because as you told at the very beginning and in many ways the government can can be ahead of the commercial or at least even at the commercial world where do you see this kind of balance or or this need for the the innovative company coming from or or how how's that kind of flowing down to you guys we do see the benefit of that sentiment or that requirement Jason. The way I would highlight it is that there is a meaningful call responsibility on part of all of his young or mature companies to truly understand the sector to understand your customers. So to speak right? So while you may have the other transactional priorities except etcetera. It does not remove the responsibility on the vendors to actually understand the federal factor and try to work towards satisfying and those customers in other words understand what problems are solving under understand how we will be beneficial to the fairly sector and areas such as the etcetera are call a means to an end not an end itself. So to speak. So as long as the vendors is are focused on what is the desired outcome they should be fine and on the on the left side the failure continuing to call it cross with the commercial factor. They will also allow things to be sped up in terms of adoption of latest technologies understanding of latest solutions and then obviously improving their security pastures reducing.\n",

      "So to speak as you highlighted the contract that we will want take us as a subject metrics, but in many cases to the agencies that is number one number two is that over the years through a combination of a solution sprint as well as our focus on their success.\n",
      "I mean we have a relationship with the aggregate as like D solutions and makes and so our contracts are very very clear with them and then they kind of value add on the other side by either supporting us or shielding us from the idiosyncrasies of their specific relationships with the agency.\n",
      "It does not remove the responsibility on the vendors to actually understand the federal factor and try to work towards satisfying and those customers in other words understand what problems are solving under understand how we will be beneficial to the fairly sector and areas such as the etcetera are call a means to an end not an end itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security of the environment also increases. So those are the two key I would say the Federal is looking for us as when is that's one reason why we work with integrations and others to deliver complete. I'm am a little surprised you didn't say the budget so many people when I ask the same first question every time know is at a good time to be a federal contractor everyone says well, we have budget uncertainty or the fact is we know the budget looks like or just got a budget deal done that that affects you a lot less than maybe a more quote traditional government contractor doesn't it in many respects. Yes, although even as a vendor we would like for better predictability on the budget and the speeding up of the budget process and the allocation to them as well because we work with other bags and larger freddy contact and the degree that they are impacted we get impacted as well, the and the significance of the benefit like we to the table is we are a very diversified business. So while the federal set is a very important factor for us as a vendor. We have a very large commercial presence as well and we always trying to call it cross meaning the trends and the technologies that we've built for a commercial sector. We try to see how they can apply to the fairly sector. And to the degree that we learn about things in the federal sector. We try to take them back to the commercial sector. So in many ways we tend to be unique in that respect and so to your point about budgets etcetera we are able to diverse higher our business because of our presence in more than eighty percent of the fortune five hundred for instance that allows us to take things into the federal sector and vice versa you bring up trends and I think that's a great segue way to the next question because what are some of the trends you are seeing whether from the commercial to the federal or vice versa as you know is a very fascinating. And especially in the Security space. The friends are evolving. I would say even faster than many other sectors lemme highlight a few and happy to elaborate on some as you please first one I would say is the security challenges that customers are facing. Let's start with the commercial factor are increasing at rates that has never been seen before that is further complicated i would say in many ways by the demand from the customers customers for more freedom and less control meaning that I want to be using a device wherever I am located I want you to move my applications to the cloud i want you to deploy a hybrid policy etcetera effort some of it is economics some of it is user experience some of it is simply user preference and all those things what happens is that it complicates security policy. It makes it more difficult for companies to ensure that their security posture is proper and protected. So that's one key aspect but the other side of the point is that companies have fewer resources to deploy and make useful these solutions. So on one hand the number of security solutions is growing on the other hand customers have fewer people and fewer resources to manage all this so the implication from a vendor community standpoint is make things incredibly easy to use make things more integrated don't make your customers environment your test labs. I mean those are all things that we subscribe to very deeply and strive to support customers and make their lives simpler as so speak that's that's one keeping two is with the advent of call the broadly seeking the internet of things more and more things are getting. Connected to the internet. So that causes a visibility problem. So to speak for customers meaning what's connecting to my network. So what is really allowed into my networks. What should we allowed to etcetera etcetera and so that has got a lot of people thinking and worrying about what the unknown service that results in if all these things are happening. Am I compliant whether it is to my internal audit needs or external audit needs to compliant becomes a bigger and bigger issue that everybody has to to worry about so these combined with the economic challenges you mentioned budget in the federal the budgets in the commercial sector always tend to be quite tight as well and so what does cloud mean can I use the cloud and save dollars become more efficient as an example, so that at the same time increases complexity from a security sample. So these are some of the broader trends that are happening. And I think the important thing from event community standpoint is make things more simple even as you keep them secure to enable to manage these things better and give customers option don't force them into the cloud or don't save them into a data center adopt hybrid approaches and give seamless access to those custom couple interesting things I want pull the let me start with obviously the increasing number of threats. We've seen that for last year know five or ten years but the the freedom side and I think that something that the government the federal government is just starting to come to grips with that and you're seeing a big push for or citizen services user experience and things like that how did you as a security vendor kind of listen to what the government is saying and take you that into account as you're developing products and solutions freedom in this particular context comes on two fronts.\n",

      "Together and we can help you that integration of course or or somebody else can help you with that integration but it's just a matter of integration versus having to find new pieces or develop new technology. Yeah one of the prominent agencies is actually part of our to council and more recently actually in me of this year we hosted a customer council which included them and other commercial customers is well we do that routinely to essentially cross best practices between commercial and Federal there we went through our zero trust solutions. Not zero test plans so to speak and simply put in the approach that we take we and authenticate users which is the ident*ty problem that you highlighted devices to ensure that the devices that are connecting compliant and have the right security posture etcetera, etcetera applications to make sure that applications are authorized to be delivered in a certain way and used by the users and last but not least the networks. So users devices applications and networks are all authorized and provided access by our solutions. The combination of those will allow a customer to deploy a zero trust environment. So the more we are able to educate them in those terms and language that they already know they're getting more and more comfortable with greater trust and obviously they derive the benefits of zero trust by not having wall. The gardens and not having different security policies for inside and outside. So we've taken that approach and while the adoption in the commercial sector has been faster. I will say that the conversations and the federal sector are also accelerating do you get a sense that the reason why the conversations are accelerating is because of the technology model you mentioned earlier. How much is changing. The hybrid technology the hybrid cloud the hybrid T that we keep hearing about to some degree. Yes. Jason. I also think to a large degree it is the obligation of vendors such ourselves to be able to articulate these things simply to the federal factor and others and highlight how we are adding value to them rather than pushing a specific product or a point solution to them in other words if we work backwards from this concept which we define entirely customer success and doing what's right and solving their problems, including integrating with third party Vendors. We will be able to accelerate the their journey and so it's a combination of really solving the problem and then mapping it on to their particular problems and environments are there other pieces of that technology model or the or the or the business model that you're seeing that they're starting to really change as you spend more time in the federal market. So as you think about the business models themselves increasingly. I feel that is a greater awareness of business models like subscription for instance, even in the federal sector, which I will not have said a few years ago but I think this is a bleed so to speak from the commercial factor into the Federal factor where more and more customers again, either budget constrained or not thinking about subscription based models as well as agencies that offer services to other agencies thinking about pay as pay pro type models as well that requires both the aggregate and contractors is to adapt and adopt new business models which then obviously translates to us as well on our side because of the fact that we've done all of this on the commercial sector. We tried to add value to our bags and contacted by update.\n",

      "First from a administrator perspective, meaning the person that is setting policies setting up infrastructure applications, etcetera. The freedom that we are trying to enable for them is how do I kinda of create investment protection for what you've already bought while you stand into new deployment. Let's say in the cloud as an example, how do I give you freedom to adopt applications that are modern than that may be delivered from the cloud without compromising what you have built over the years in your data centers how do I policies security practices are consistent between the cloud and the data center. So that's broadly called hybrid. I or hybrid security in this particular context. So that's a level of freedom we need to provide to everybody including the federal sector because that's becoming an increasingly important requirement. Obviously there's an economic dimension to budget. I dimension to it as well on the other side I would call them end users requiring freedom and that could be be it use my mobile device be it use my system from anywhere be it local be remote in another country without compromising my security posture and giving me freedom to be productive freedom. Essentially equates to simplicity which then allows you to more productive what we have done is on the end user side we have client software that is identical across all platforms. So whether you take windows mac linux etc. What we ensure is that the user experience and all of those platforms is identical. So when a customer or end users which is from one platform to another they don't have to learn things that's. A very important element of giving them freedom to choose whatever platform. They wanna use then obviously there is the integration into the platform itself where they don't feel like they're using separate and new technology. So in other words what we have done is on all operating systems we have a approach which we call a workspace in fact, many customers in the Federal sector use this particular product which allows it and user to use any device or their choosing but as long as they have the workspace because the workspace is protected. So you're separating always the person from the business that also is an option that we give to the federal sector where they able to not have to procure a lot more devices then they absolutely need to and then worry about how they lock them down so that's another form of freedom that both types of freedom that we just discussed let's take a quick break when come back we can jump into some of those other things you talked about in terms of trends. My guest is to Doc Krishna the CEO of post. I'm and you're listening the interviews from a corner office on Federal news radio part of the Federal news network. Welcome back your listing interviews corner office on Federal news radio part of the Federal news network. I'm my guess is Doc Krishna the CEO of post now before break we're talking about some of the trends and one of the trends you brought up that I wanna come touch pod is the most iot o T connected devices internet of things whatever. We're gonna call it these days and so much of it as you said causes is a visibility problem as agencies are putting more things online. They have to be able to protect and know that they're there walk me through that challenge of if you can't see it you can't protect it. This is becoming increasingly relevant thing both in the commercial sector as well as in the fairly sector. I cannot tell you how many times I would go to a customer for him instance, the conversation goes like.\n",

      "Element I should say becomes incredibly difficult. So that's where we kind of learned our ropes so to speak on working with partners and being dedicated to partners and we carried that forward into the federal second we've been doing that for the better part of ten years many times when I talk to what I talked to for the show there they had a federal very senior vice President maybe their President very rarely do I get actually the CEO especially for a large business like yourselves. So what's a day to day CEO like you get up in the morning and you're checking your email and what else like give it a typical day for you at typical day for me is a series of meetings some meetings with our go to market team. So I when I wake up generally try to touch base with the teams in Europe where it's already mid day for instance for them that gives me a head start on what's happening on Europe and a typical drive to the workplace if I'm not traveling to a customer or a partner would involve touching base with the a series of my teammates server whether it be my marketing counterpart my c f o except I just quick touch base on how things are going what happening what needs to be done etcetera etcetera and then one time at work. I like to describe my job as trying to enable others and eliminate roadblocks so to that and I spend a lot of time in. Let's say a budget meeting or planning meeting or sometimes we prepare for our external boards and investors to to call it update them on the health of the business the progress of the business etcetera, but also tried to spend at least thirty percent of my time. If not more with customers and partners and I also tend to spend a lot of time with my employees because at the end of the day if I can have a satisfied employee base i know my customers will be taken care of this is we get to the part of the show this one of my favorite parts because I get to learn something about you. That maybe most people don't know or that's outside of this federal commercial cyber cybersecurity world what's maybe one thing about yourself that you like to do outside of work or that something different about you that maybe some people don't know that's the interesting question based I would say I'm not doing much of it now but when I was quite a bit younger I to him C above and his three bus and so a team of us three to four of us would go from one city to another and essentially compete or SPA with other teams in terms of who new that see we are the best. So it's similar to like jeopardy and others, but it's not as structured and it was much more free flowing we used to enjoy that a lot because there was a certain camaraderie alternate and a certain level of creativity and exploration involved in it. So that is something that I don't think a lot of people know about me. So did you ever go out for jeopardy. No not not for jeopardy here not not yet at least right not yet yet that least yes. That's a more optimistic and and was there a part of the trivial issue that you were special specialized in were you more about geography versus something else who knows I was more focused than history and sports so both and history. Alright very cool very interesting. Alright well let's take another the quick break when come back we can complete our conversation. I guess is dot call Krishna. The CEO post here I'm Miller and you're listening to view from recorder office on Federal news radio part of the Federal news network. Welcome back to listening interviews from a corner office on Federal news radio part of the Federal news network. I mean host Jason Miller my guest is Krishna.

      "This generally ask a customer how many devices do you think are at any point in time connected to your network who was connecting and connecting to your network and oftentimes. Let's say they come up with an answer like five thousand and within a few weeks of running some software and identifying what's getting connected to them we t find that they're off by a factor of two or three and in some cases in factor of ten in many cases. So what happens is that that really creates a aha moment for them saying I if I don't even know what's trying to connect to my network how will I ever be able to protect it and that is really the visibility challenge and that's greatly exacerbated by the the whole I o t trend or as you said connected internet where on one hand. I say it is very good and very productive for all of these devices to be connected to the internet. Why simply because it makes administrators life in terms of understanding various forms of connections connectivity and usage that much more simpler, but with that kind of freedom comes the complexity of what is the security capabilities of these devices they're running the right types of software how can I attach policy to that all those things become very important. And that's where the first step is to understand what is being connected to the network and then a**lyze the visibility challenge and again, this has become a very top of my topic for both commercial as well as the Federal factor. I know in the Federal sector. They're using the continuous diagnostics and mitigation or C p m program and and that has played a big role and understanding me what's on agencies networks at the same time know to secure those devices they may know that they're there. Think that that leaves us down the path of another kind of related trend which is why zero trust is getting so much attention in the federal market and and I know you guys are in the zero trust world too. But let's walk me through a little bit zero trust we know that umbrella. It's a framework. It's not aiming one technology, but what are you seen from when you talk to agency about zero trust and it is becoming increasingly at top of mind topic traditional way of looking at security was you had an enterprise boundary or a parameter call it a wall garden every bit of traffic that comes from outside the enterprise per was deemed unsafe for by definition and therefore had to be protected and authorized on the everything that was inside the parameter was deemed secure and should have free access increasingly what's happening and this happened a lot more in the commercial factor is that more and more threat starting from inside the network and think of a very simple case I'm working on my computer at home. I get infected by something happening on the internet. I come inside the network parameter meaning inside my office. I'll open up my laptop and I have the danger of interacting the entire system. So that's becoming increasingly prevalent and there are many more sophisticated ways of doing that, but I'm giving you a very basic example that is leading to this notion of hey, I icon. I can't trust traffic coming from the outside nor should I trust anything that inside leading to the concept of zero trust while on one hand everybody's beginning to be aligned on trust. What it also creates is what is the best way most economical way and simply put the most secure way of addressing this zero trust challenge and that's what when is like us and others. Are attempting thing to do both for the commercial sector as well as the federal factor. When you talk to your federal clients when you work with your your partners is you ever trust one of those things that just comes up constantly or is it something that's maybe more that that just starting to come up now or last six months. I would say it is increasingly coming up Jason and I would say the number of asks or mentions is actually accelerating is bit probably the best way to categorize it and at the same time though nobody's really doing zero trust at least from my perspective the people I've talked to I think a lot of people are are just talking about it. You is that something near seeing or do you you actually see the pieces being put in place to create that zero trust environment. I would actually humbly submit that we and some others are actually addressing zero trust in a very comprehensive way rights on the get go and increasingly as our portfolio use continue to evolve this support the freedom requirement that we spoke about both for administrators and end users of what we're really doing now is mapping what we do through the concept of zero trust. So in other words. This is not a case of a new concept coming up and then everybody catching up to it. We are all figuring out how to reinforce and rename size what we do in the zero trust framework. So in that trigger regard i would say the solution from us and some others are actually closer to customer needs then simply a concept that's interesting because you hear so much to talk about it and never says well there's the the ident*ty management piece and then there's the you know hardware a*set so for us that management piece and these kind of all these pieces and parts that fit on the umbrella, but that's good to hear that you know it's it's it's almost like the the message from Vendors like yourselves is that hey, the pieces are there you just as agency maybe just have to put them.\n",

      "You're listening to interviews from a corner Office on Federal news radio part of the Federal news network. I'm your host Jason my guest is Krishna the CEO post no see before break we're talking about the transition and some of the the difference between being a a vendor and the marketplace versus a contractor. So let's get into little more deep depth about what whole here is you role in the federal market and as well as your role as CEO talk a little bit about your company S c e o obviously my main focus is customer success as I previously defined regardless of the sector that the customers are in whether be the federal factor or in the commercial sector. We have a strategy within the company of full fulfilling almost everything we sell through our partners partners are a lot of value to customers. They provide direct touch to customers etcetera, but equally we believe in maintaining direct touch and contacts with as many customers as we possibly can almost every agency in the Federal sector is our customer as well granted through our and our partners some of the agencies are actually on our customer council. So we get a direct connection and connectivity with these customers. We're able to have conversations about trends highlight what's happening in the commercial sector learn from them as to their aspirations for their agencies and others and then work with our partners in terms of responding to larger r F p full fulfilling etcetera. So the way I would describe it is we have a direct touch model with the end customer and a indirect full element model with the likes of loyalty solutions and and others walk me through what a typical of you will bid would look like for company like here is vendor versus a contractor you your partners with a a systems integrated do they call you up and say hey we. Partially walk me a little bit just through maybe something that's typical I give you a couple of scenarios that are typical and one is customers has already deployed a solution to both our touch and the partners touch over the years and they're looking at. Let's say expanding slash modernizing right in those cases. It's a much simpler programming model because we are already in the environment and the customers looking to expand it still comes to us through the resource slash aggregate slash contractor, but it's a fairly straightforward. Then so to speak in other cases the contract that might have and a field. Let's call it a hey, the agencies looking for increase then improved visibility. We been asked to respond with specific vendor solutions can you work with us on responding and creating a very comprehensive response to the agency. So that is the other form which is much more elongated at some level but we go through that process as well and in many cases with our partner as well as the agencies need take so those are the two typical models. It's it's rarely something where out of the blue they come to us and say hey do you have something like this. It's interesting. There's the two kind of paths you guys go down on so kind of get in front of the customer and and work with with your partners. How different is that then just bidding on your own did you guys ever think about maybe we would just sell directly to the government or have you always gone down the path of partners and value added resources. We've always gone down the path of partners and value every resources you could say that some degree that comes from a commercial heritage because in the commercial space. We are in every major geography. We have over twenty thousand customers so providing touch to every one of them.\n",

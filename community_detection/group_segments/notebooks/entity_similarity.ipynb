That is number one and number two in the dialog box game never went away is also is there a time of that's built into it?  So the dialogue should show if there is a life cast which which is headed by someone immediately to Cho and the disappearing part is when recorder joins, it should disappear and when I give a staging build on Friday, so I in Trenton both tested and it was coming and going away.  Because after that different party quarter and that the client was not posting message on that circuit because it was from another planet. So like that's why that guy look might be disappearing.  Why did the dialogue no timeouts I thought there is error handling that if we are founded in join or sometime after sometime, it will disappear, right?  I haven't written that logic like if the record is enjoying with in one one and a half minute, or I think it's two minutes got a call saying so one and half minute then the call will end. altogether  Yeah, I'm also because in staging we have less number of pooled instances according instances.

Do you want to deploy the current Master fix all the issues in iOS and button changes push it to production and then take you did see me or do we take little singing 42 staging and what are the issues? What how should we do this?  Possibly how to make the stable as as should meet our expectations like whatever the changes that we are expecting out of staging try to get this table will try to deploy all the latest branches or whatever is expected to work and they'll do an integration. And once we are sure that everything is done and if we want to make sure he'll be poor and then we'll figure out the way to go first. It's in it because adding that to the equation will make it little more complex at least for now.

But in this case, how do we mean is interface Integrations? And we have all right now like we're not even thinking like not even I mean maybe week later on like an Enterprise. We kind of we figure out something else as I we, you know, we we figured out all the strike like if we can figure out how to do to the other side. Because Enterprise see right now the target is that that disordered phase of thing. It's it's like what you said B to B be too. What does it mean to see with Envy of okay, you're directly targeting small teams with ability. Just charge it up to the current use. It's not enterprise software. It's not being installed and managed by that it admins before we are getting your ideas, which is like Slack. Where to go to Target direct end users like small things. Let's say so the my experience for example in working with other things is like lot of times like I work with this nonprofit come heart feels a lot of work. I do feel and I use tons of it tools all of them. I just go subscribe sign up pay with my credit card annoyed by people and start using it right because utility of the tool is more important than manageability right according to our octaves All of these guys, that's what they do here. But the thing is in case of medium level companies are companies with like 30 40 members even he's not getting our case. Who basically also there is the matter of me. Yeah, something like that. But the thing is he should be should be able to get it VMS or something like that, but that's what happens.  You know $100 you start to really get into like like the way for example when we use when we did slack a group on before Group One Direction. Okay inhaler, for example, the way we did it was I signed up for slack and at the finance person as an admin and a finance person prayed for their political Liberty. We did that for slack it that a wh sorry that I do not of it is managed at that level.  The goal of this by the way, so you will be don't know where this will go whether this becomes right now. Anyway, no Enterprises using right and we're finding it hard to penetrate the Enterprise and a variety of reasons, right the is good friends with everybody what other things can we it's a very focused experimental slack doesn't work. We know that because they're about three or four campaigns is here since launch it one in July August. Most people came from mobile and drop of common mobile economicus. I can drop off items for mobile users is going to be very friendly to start installing downloading and going  Remember, you don't like a lot of people can install and use because it's there's a Big Freedia. Yeah, it's only everybody inside up and strategies which is why I want I want people to see the sign up and we'll start using it.  Let's see, we need to get about a hundred hundred kind of pins For us to be able to say that whatever we have built is actually be used and then we cannot take it to monetization body, which is which is around.

Maybe we keep ones like like abstracted out. The back like the channel is always there except it's theirs. It's part of the flag. For example, is that if you notice They asked what is your team name? Then they ask you what it's about and then they will create a channel with that by default. Yeah that make everybody.  In the background, we can create a channel name the same as being named and make everybody portal. For example one channel. Well, uh, then that later on if you want extreme teens just falls into place.  Sweet things that we're still working on stopping while I don't think about organization. Once the user is there how do we relate user team meeting? Another things is we can do it very rarely in back and work for example, just keep invisible. Yes simple thing, but forget about inviting all that forget about public link just keep Kings ability as a first step for example.  \n",

I'm not sure so that we need to tell us for example, especially to see how does this end? I mean because we're using AWS.  Yeah, I decided I was expecting more traction from like this Lord. Yes surface because the Navy because we use the product we think that it is easy because we have gone through it multiple times. How does the external right, you know, I can see why you like for example looks like in front of someone else.  What is what is it stopping a smaller teams? Just like startup loyalty for some reason people like our page and they go through and click on let's say five thousand people visit 200 people will connect this line, which is great.  They're interested enough to click on that. We don't know why because you know that we don't have that. We don't know that that's what people do they just install it right things up with they would rather do that than spend a lot of time researching into your product. The best way is in standard item and if they like it, they'll continue if they think it's like famous examples to duel this right everyone feels like I need to manage my life. So they sign up for a to-do list and try to use it. Then I will use it and then drop all another but at least you go.  See the phone you're our politics page will give you all kinds of dashboard. How many people clicked on it? How many installed are buried in the face you what are the reasons? Why doesn't give me anything?  Aussie that is just one way to look at it another way to look at it is if they want their app mechanism Marketplace to grow then we lot of people like us yeah, that is why people are not going exclusively on slack. Yea verily they are going is lightweight slack Innovations rather than going completely insane not then build up build up build on top of slack is Integrations, like one degree duration exactly. That's a very lightweight more like zoom and  He had meant you know, I'll bet was that slack be very friction-free and they will be doing all kinds of improvements to improve their Marketplace. Even this is in that Marketplace support is exactly as it was two years ago as well casing when we started.  opens edit mode eventually has at least sounded promising in the beginning because we were having a lot of issues. There are many users. Okay, it solves your condemnation is but our tissues and on the flavor.  French song baby just start sort of a Google doc and start putting like bullet items things that we need to think of, right? Then we will will scope it out. I'm sure you and Karthik do this.  It's a great week. Like I'm off next week. I have some personal things and then fall of every NBA player standing next to it. So basically I'll be like I'll be gone from next week.  unburden seems like a like extension of three that I should be talking about either from the top of the yeah, like because it should be featured a false flag because we've built so tightly that addresses keeping point of them all best practices in terms of what slack is trying to do, but they were doing this itself makes slack useful rather than making slack more useful most giving them access to data which today they don't have any way xs0 organization is going to bring all of that back into slack is huge.  that's what I was expecting at least because it addresses lot of issues that can right now is like faces also. Yeah, and if you have like a, you know tidy up relationships like rather than as an ambassador of Slack So maybe it's all ideas. Like if I meeting you I will buy with the video generation gods are bringing them back package together. Something's wrong with the way. They're supporting their ecosystem. and they need to fix them and when we when they fix it, but we can't yeah that definitely because our entire area is locked.  \n",

Maybe we support simple things like flash command and then pushing somebody back into sir? Something very simple, like the real like similar to zoom, right? If you type / meet click here to Gene is you've already integrated with your user account. You click on it. It will say click to join very similar to zoom.  Comedies in Florida DeLorean or anything? There's no DeLorean only in the sense of like also no way to convert itself. We can show live meetings and they think you can watch ongoing meetings. Like we do today already we that so it is like I was at least there's an ongoing meeting you will see.  Somebody's reduced or the summaries looking mainly because one thing we can think about is whether when the meeting is over, we will email the summary to the like in zoo animals. Somebody purposely created the meat.  This and other than my ta p.m. Because if is one which is currently represented slack naturally there are action between if you moving out from Flat nose much instant actors, and we have little bit dependency in of slack in APS that will be arriving in New Zealand.  Because I look for a particular user do we have to maintain the like contacts history or something like Mike? By default it will be again inviting the similar set of people right? We may have to show the things right like  Hundreds we can think that there might be a feature kind of thing. But a team like recent contacts, let's say if I invite somebody very frequently. Yeah, we can pop in the same that giving a solution like as soon as I enter.  Yes, Google contacts only but the thing is it's if it is outside of the team if you are a casual, but it'll take it is 0 it is land like, you know, because those things we can do.  \n",

I can invite Microsoft at little of the diode will join my zoom waiting. Yeah, that is automatically summarize it for me is that is used to case.  Because we are currently relying on the Zoom app to send us the events are receiving some needed and you can still do that. But the thing is if you're targeting A Team level hierarchy things and room are busy Enterprise level if anybody did we can't tie them together. because if you are somebody to inshallah zoom app just to get you know us to join because you can basically what he's saying is let's say this in our company and I've invited all of you guys, but I think I have a zoom  It's like again if you want to go to a proper enterprise portal, then we have to do everything that we are talking about which is as an admin admin create signs up for it creates and seems version seems of those things.  Whether we have to go there shouldn't thinking extend this model because we are actually breaking the Enterprise model TT model and then again going to but let's think of that though. So what do we mean by like Enterprise model for all this? As follows that is not slack that works such as it works later price. So let's take Trello for example is a good example internalized can sign up like we've done I've done sign up. I've invited everybody and we use Channel works very well. Hello for Enterprise. What it means is that one SSO support. Okay, this is support is the big one immediately. So they now have to connect like sign up with Google whatever and all the SS of machines. Everything comes in either does or secondly there is there is an inherent understanding of teams are all of that. It's a like for example, like wheel everything through what is it mean like Like if I'm saying that for a hundred years is doing right everybody for me time. I'm very sad meeting voicemail everybody those types of things coming in the picture, but I'm not sure if there's anything else fundamentally that doesn't make it work for the Enterprise except for the organization of things. So if you think Argus it like a bunch of him sitting together. Yeah, then we can you can yeah, we can put an umbrella and like everybody just they already has a team.  we can we can place a you had your team something that you created you created a ask people to join link that into that may be having this kind of this kind of hierarchy my point being you don't need for frequent comes Enterprise installs is only three or four things that we need things to go to high level one is how does orders on board you are like, how does the admin install this is installs and and then single sign-on in our case, we got by single sign-on because authenticate with flat right? So that's our single second century and then permissions slack permissions membership site Channel, which who which team are you part of based on which team were part of what you get to see what do not get to see so that's the theme organization or to figure out. Portis encryption which is a problem even today for us right which we don't refer to any way an interesting is what about like separate cloud and these types of things.  \n",

      "The challenge we have we all like our one big problem we have right now A Fairytale go to marketers. folks are going to  then because of multiple reasons one reason is that people like what we have them? Okay. They think it's very interesting. I think it's really easy, even though they're not slack uses a click on add a slack and they get like a nice and drop off that is one reason second reason which we already know is that not everybody can actually install and slack. Yes only admins can and the whole thing which all the Black Ops 2 like stand-up Lee and others which is copy to admin and you know, like share this in and minerals everyone in today's it's once you get there if it's not if you can't move forward you have kind of learned to objects that don't ask so our whole back down / is phase is not is completely faked M which is that we can write. It completely on top of slack and you know, like they will pick you will adopt it use it etcetera. Okay, so this is a big problem that we have. Solving thinking about it for a few weeks now about how to do what we should do and how we can do multiple things differently and they say something like easier but also slack is not helping us. Okay slack is not making this any easier. They don't have anything on the roadmap to make any dish whole onboarding thing very easy. They don't know what they don't like like there's nothing that you're supporting. It's like it's like the best example I can give is it's like iPhone giving telling after the first nuclear power, but I'm going to make it really hard for you.  This is probably why a lot of companies have not gone completely built ins like which is they've built in a and they're provided some slack Innovation. So if you are and I'd user and you want to see things like then you can install a news but can you do that? Anyway, this is a kind of been thinking about this for a while and I want to awesome. Which is it's a pretty big change. So like where it milnes which is for us to like get away. Yes. That's the bottom line. So then the question is what is it that we want to do. So for a minute don't they overthink? It just hear us out and then we will have a discussion home. Well pros and cons and you know what to do. Take care. All right. Yes, so  We had the same discussion like this slack. We wanted to Target small difference and because we used to have the discussion.

      "The problem is he right now it is like the data tells us that you can drive users also as the slide and then you don't know what happened. They like polygons with yes.  Eventually be I think so. You can see it's either admin or see I'll tell you from being formally from my people have tried to you know, bring on board. Most of them don't use slack evenly. Yeah, we're of Cipher don't use like heavily, but lot of them say, you know, I wish I can use this with my business partners and I fingered of my team independent online. We don't slack but I like what you guys are them and they use it as out slack. So that's the question that comes up now. I don't know how many such people are there by but the point is that right now we don't have data. We're kind of running like it's no kind of really neat like user track through very whatever it is useless. So so what here's what I'm thinking so you go to the web page there is sign up so assume that we've done marketing campaigns people are going to their page they like what they see and they click on sign up. Okay, what they do is immediately repeat in into this is a Familiar model all of those are fraction leaving just go them and say signing using Google. Let's say even slack whatever. We just think about it. We just purely sign in it's like an overthrow it slack doesn't do it. You can't do the same things they do.  And when I say I love signed up are taken to this page, by the way, this is officially something very simple as a political agenda right like a high level. And they go here you type in the female. Remember girl that put Tesla invite my teammates my email and you can be anybody you don't care about checking whether the same domain and all that. He is ready for its you properly. Okay add more as many as you want click on done. So invite goes out. Everybody goes in they are blind they become part of this team.  Then once they're done, they're directly taken into this is this dashboard which is a protocol of July. Oh, right, you're logged into this thing called Tesla, which is similar to of slack workspace around him as user is on whatever and you see me class notes ches ches selects like I was missing conspicuously, but milk has notes is that and then resume it clicks you okay? I want to do is when you click on me Lexi you have an option of creating meeting name and we asked them what is this meeting about and they select the mind. Okay. So after engineering violence, whatever right we what our minds we support everything right others by email. Okay. I'll get a meeting link and share. Okay, which we can also do We can even do things like make this meeting public in private bunch of other things, right? So if it's a public meeting, then we can share a public link. Anybody can join if it's a file by default. It will be privately something like that. And once you have taken into me similar to how Hangouts meat works today, once your enemy you can actually give invite others. So we'll take a look at how that works. So this is the meat is feels  Then C. Let's say you need a bunch of me. You know me cause I know you're in Netflix, you're seeing all the summaries and all of that, right? So there's somebody everything. Is that the share icon for each one of them? You click on that share and then you can say invite why I email. So I can invite a bunch of people or I can click on select because I've already invited people from a team. I can click and say just boxed everything right? Like I can select multiple users the constant I can say or I can make it public. Okay will generate a shareable link very soon. We can move, you know, optionally do things like Shadow areas like by then by default. It will be a public link on the point. There's no slack permissions authentication if we share it in the slide, it becomes public but the public will tell them that so that means that we're doing share like which is what one of the things that we're seeing is all the people or being like sharing Wears Like Roundup Republicans. So nobody's like really worried roll like this privacy right now maybe in Down the road. We find a way to integrate that slack model. I care. Okay. So this is this is this shift that  In the Privacy concern like only the meeting attendees can be will be able to view the limiting the beginning currently if you don't cherish your you haven't even shown your dashboard. Okay, you're entertaining hour with you can see share Mighty something like this is the higher the higher level resource is the team right? It's a flat team with numbers starting with numbers and If you if you want and everybody in the team will be able to share this meeting with others who is not part of the deal. Then you use the default key. I'm watching me right now that's idea, you know. So here we are singing about is also like doing multiple teams groups are all that but then you get into a very excellent business altogether different future. What we can do is we can give them like a slack integration options. In and say sync my team with slack or something and we're that point we connect with slack will the members and becomes a channel exactly we can do something like right now, let's keep it dead. Simple. The idea is that we want to see if going this route makes it easier for other people to right now. What's happening is people are really experiencing of this is the biggest this will make the first meeting.  \n",

      "You can think of an embedding as a vector that represents the meaning of a word and we can visualize the data set word embeddings using the tensorflow embedding projector and there is an online demo you can find in the description here.\n",
      "Were looking at a data set of XnumberX,XnumberX words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to XnumberXD so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you will find similar words are often close together.\n",
      "There are thousands of different jobs and an embedding could be used to help your classifier.\n",
      "If you think about how we age correlates with income our first intuition if that is aging creases usually sodas income and the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here.\n",
      "Well, In tensorflow, we can create a bucket size feature by wrapping a numeric column from the CSV and here we are specifying the number and the ranges of the buckets.\n",
      "That means there is one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance.\n",
      "We do not have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions.\n",
      "Now using the wrong value is the right thing to do when they are only a small will cover the case where there are thousands of First let us take a look at feature Crossing.\n",
      "Now, if we do not know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically.\n",
      "And the goal is to predict the income is greater than XnumberX,XnumberX based on attributes like their age and occupation.\n",
      "It is flat for children than increases during working age and decreases during retirement a linear classifier for example is unable to capture this relationship.\n",

      "You care about Thanks for watching everyone and I will see you next time.\n",
      "Easier for the classifier one thing we can do is bucket the feature bucketing transforms numeric feature into several categorical Ones based on the range of falls into and each of these new features indicate where persons aged falls into that range and now a linear model capture the relationship by learning different weights for each bucket.\n",
      "Picture column is one way to efficiently represent the categorical feature with a large vocabulary more importantly you can use these as a way to make your data easier to work with because they free you from having to provide a vocabulary list in this example will represent the occupation column from our CSV file by using a hash XnumberX,XnumberX possible values notice.\n",
      "Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file.\n",
      "For example, all of the words in this cluster cities what is neat about weddings is that they are learned automatically process of training a DNA and to make that happen.\n",
      "Well, if we think more closely about age we realize it is not in a linear relationship with income the curve might look something like this.\n",
      "If you have a large vocabulary, it can be memoryintensive to use that as input to a neural network.\n",
      "Youll also find complete code to train a tensorflow estimator on this data set.\n",
      "It is one of the most important contributions you can make to machine learning experiment feature columns are great because they let you experiment with different representations and code make advanced features like embeddings accessible as a next step.\n",
      "Learn the words like programmer and software engineer often mean the same thing.\n",
      "The data can be a combination of internal and external data internal data is collected from existing customers and can include customer data as well.\n",
      "So it is larger than the number of items in the vocabulary.\n",
      "And here we see some groups are likely to have high income and others low in code using a feature cross works the same way as before we will cross our age buckets with education and add it to the list of features to use the featured cross can generate many possibilities quickly which is why they are often represented under the hood with the hat.\n",
      "Conveniently, there is a live demo runs in the browser with our census data preloaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person.\n",
      "We had the bucket size feature to the list used to train our model.\n",
      "Come back features of the way you represent your knowledge about the world for the classifier.\n",
      "We use a data set from the US Census as an example.\n",
      "Let is see how represent a categorical feature and I will use the education column as an example because there are only a few values the best way to represent.\n",
      "Like to mention embeddings and these can be less intuitive than the other techniques but there are powerful way to work with categorical data and keep learning settings.\n",
      "If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts.\n",
      "You can think of a truefalse feature being created for each bucket that tells the classifier whether an individual falls into that range.\n",
      "Were building a list of features used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature called this contains data about the come from the CSV file and how to represent it.\n",
      "Crossing is a way to create new features that are combinations of existing ones and these can be especially helpful to linear classifiers, which cannot model interactions between\n",
      "Is that is stored as a CSV file and previously we have seen how to use the column values directly speakers.\n",
      "Of course, you could also read the values from a file on disk rather than writing the mountain code.\n",
      "The downside is that could be collisions mean different items are mapped to the same value.\n",
      "Crashes can also be used to limit memory usage at the cost of adding some noise to your training data.\n",
      "That is because it learns a single way to reach feature.\n",
      "And today I will walk you through techniques you can use to represent your features and utilities tensorflow provides down.\n",

      "So we short about XnumberX million weeks and months see about eight to nine billion clicks and I am about XnumberX billion aggressive Target.\n",

      "You can think of an embedding as a vector that represents the meaning of a word and we can visualize the data set word embeddings using the tensorflow embedding projector and there is an online demo you can find in the description here.\n",
      "Were looking at a data set of XnumberX,XnumberX words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to XnumberXD so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you will find similar words are often close together.\n",

      "If you think about how we age correlates with income our first intuition if that is aging creases usually sodas income and the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here.\n",
      "Well, In tensorflow, we can create a bucket size feature by wrapping a numeric column from the CSV and here we are specifying the number and the ranges of the buckets.\n",
      "That means there is one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance.\n",

      "Easier for the classifier one thing we can do is bucket the feature bucketing transforms numeric feature into several categorical Ones based on the range of falls into and each of these new features indicate where persons aged falls into that range and now a linear model capture the relationship by learning different weights for each bucket.\n",
      "Picture column is one way to efficiently represent the categorical feature with a large vocabulary more importantly you can use these as a way to make your data easier to work with because they free you from having to provide a vocabulary list in this example will represent the occupation column from our CSV file by using a hash XnumberX,XnumberX possible values notice.\n",
      "Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file.\n",

      "Let is see how represent a categorical feature and I will use the education column as an example because there are only a few values the best way to represent.\n",
      "Like to mention embeddings and these can be less intuitive than the other techniques but there are powerful way to work with categorical data and keep learning settings.\n",
      "If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts.\n",
      "You can think of a truefalse feature being created for each bucket that tells the classifier whether an individual falls into that range.\n",
      "Were building a list of features used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature called this contains data about the come from the CSV file and how to represent it.\n",

If you think about how we age correlates with income our first intuition if that is aging creases usually sodas income and the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here. We're building a list of features used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature called this contains data about the come from the CSV file and how to represent it. Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file. Now what can go wrong with this approach? Well, if we think more closely about age we realize it's not in a linear relationship with income the curve might look something like this. It's flat for children than increases during working age and decreases during retirement a linear classifier for example is unable to capture this relationship.

Conveniently, there's a live demo runs in the browser with our census data pre-loaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person. Now let's bucket by age and you can adjust the number of buckets to make it more or less granular how you choose the number of buckets is up to you and ideally you want to use your knowledge of the problem to do this.

We don't have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions. I said the half size. So it's larger than the number of items in the vocabulary. Here's how this works under the hood. Normally a categorical feature is represented as a 100 coating. That means there's one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance. Now, if we don't know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically. The downside is that could be collisions mean different items are mapped to the same value. Crashes can also be used to limit memory usage at the cost of adding some noise to your training data.

So we're going to talk about a little bit about how it is. Did it happen today? So real quick a little bit of background about me. So I'm the director of customer set that bit me. I we are based in New York. And have been that way for about two and a half years is to make something like this oldest employee of Italy at the moment. So I feel like I've been around the block a few times. So my team we've got about and got seven people on the team right now. We're hiring aggressively and then just a little bit about that lie so that Li you guys all probably know busy in some capacity of not go on Twitter and the person is palpable the Ability Link. I'm sure but we were establishing 2008 to solve like a very real problem on the web which was that link for too long the books. So pretty basic there when it's painted in about 60 employees three offices you want differences again with about 1,200 Enterprise clients. So the first question I always get when I say that I'm a director customers accessibility is how to Simply make money and what does it mean that you manage accounts up lately? A lot of people don't realize that we have an Enterprise product. We have about 1200 Enterprise customers. We've got 9 million freezes and both of those will let me to the customer success team which presenting challenges and of itself. We kind of the size and scale of Italy is also interesting. So we short about 600 million weeks and months see about eight to nine billion clicks and I'm about 2 billion aggressive Target. There's a little bit of background sort of understand the size and scale. So now I'm basically just going to take you guys through the story of like what we did Billy nothing.

So what we decided was that our client base was actually our biggest opportunity as well as our biggest challenge. So like many of you I'm sure what happened with Bentley as we go and we sellable one small piece of information. So you take a company like Pepsi and we're working with Pepsi or not working with Gatorade and we're not working with Mountain Dew Amazon and all of the different subsidiaries or different business. So we decided at the beginning of 2014 was that we're going to try something. We were going to rewrite the rules between sales and customer success. And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and for everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it. Basically what we decided to do with that customer success. We're going to own all upsells how we defined an upsell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with own that entire parent company relationship. So if we close the Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and that we do and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that those to be like a massive opportunities that customer success was not only that relationship instead of sales. \"], '2020-02-10T09:27:58Z', 'fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315', 'c3f4a4b8-5750-49ad-81ab-90c6d1fa9a90'], [[\"This basically to talk a little bit about the strategy when we when we put it in the place that they him 2014 and taking this opportunity away from sales and putting it.

So what we found out very quickly was and this is it comes in motion talk to anybody in this room. But the more meeting have especially in person meeting the higher the upsell value the way more likely you're going and he built the comp plan. So, of course if you're going to have customer success manager is managing upsells or to come them a little bit more like salespeople. So what we did was we took everyone's bonus structure and instead of making that based on, you know, we Cut the piece that was going to based on renewals and Fern and business effective. So they had that piece and then they also had a commission fees so they could essentially earn as much money as they possibly could with that outsell. So portable. This was a quote actually promoting my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsell to you. So basically what we did was we putting in these meeting quotas. He said like the more you talk to your customers the more you are going to sell. I promise you. The better relationship you have the more money that's going to come in. They're going to want these people want to spend money with people a like if you will they talk to you all the time. Not just people who are helping them in a crisis. So I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun here and go a little bit to our results and then I'm gonna go back to why we can get work. So within one year of moving all the upselling and focusing on upsell within our group we decrease turn by 25% Upsell increase by two hundred and sixty-seven percent and one of the things people always ask me with this is you guys have more resources.

So not much of a split here on the other hand if we look at age, we realize that everybody who's hundred twenty years old download Pokemon Gold whereas everybody who is 20 or older didn't that's a nice split. So the feature the best splits the data is H there for you. He said age. That was correct. So we're going to do is run a question here. The question is are you younger than 20? If yes, then we'll recommend Pokemon go to you. If not, then we'll see. So what happens if you're 20 or older then we look at the gender. It seems like here if you're a female you've downloaded. What's up, if your mail, it's downloaded Snap Chat. So we had another question here. The question is are you female or male or female? We recommend what's up and if your mail and recommend Snapchat? \"], '2020-02-10T09:46:20Z', 'fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315', '27f97eb8-7f24-4e5e-b146-2814e0f04e3a'], [[\"The end up here is with the decision tree and the decisions are given by the question. We asked. And this decision tree was built with the datum. Now whenever we have a new user we can put them to the position tree and recommend them whatever happened we suggest is to recommend. For example, they have a young person. You recommend them for C'Mon go. If you have an older person you check their gender. It's a female you're recommending what's up, and it's a male the recommend Snapchat. \"], '2020-02-10T09:47:32Z', 'fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315', '0b2f7e64-c10c-4cce-ba89-21f305fd72e2']] \n",

      "Were looking at a data set of XnumberX,XnumberX words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to XnumberXD so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you will find similar words are often close together.\n",
      "There are thousands of different jobs and an embedding could be used to help your classifier.\n",
      "If you think about how we age correlates with income our first intuition if that is aging creases usually sodas income and the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here.\n",
      "Well, In tensorflow, we can create a bucket size feature by wrapping a numeric column from the CSV and here we are specifying the number and the ranges of the buckets.\n",
      "That means there is one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance.\n",
      "We do not have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions.\n",
      "Now using the wrong value is the right thing to do when they are only a small will cover the case where there are thousands of First let us take a look at feature Crossing.\n",
      "Now, if we do not know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically.\n",
      "And the goal is to predict the income is greater than XnumberX,XnumberX based on attributes like their age and occupation.\n",

      "You care about Thanks for watching everyone and I will see you next time.\n",
      "Easier for the classifier one thing we can do is bucket the feature bucketing transforms numeric feature into several categorical Ones based on the range of falls into and each of these new features indicate where persons aged falls into that range and now a linear model capture the relationship by learning different weights for each bucket.\n",
      "Picture column is one way to efficiently represent the categorical feature with a large vocabulary more importantly you can use these as a way to make your data easier to work with because they free you from having to provide a vocabulary list in this example will represent the occupation column from our CSV file by using a hash XnumberX,XnumberX possible values notice.\n",
      "Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file.\n",
      "For example, all of the words in this cluster cities what is neat about weddings is that they are learned automatically process of training a DNA and to make that happen.\n",
      "Well, if we think more closely about age we realize it is not in a linear relationship with income the curve might look something like this.\n",
      "If you have a large vocabulary, it can be memoryintensive to use that as input to a neural network.\n",
      "Youll also find complete code to train a tensorflow estimator on this data set.\n",
      "It is one of the most important contributions you can make to machine learning experiment feature columns are great because they let you experiment with different representations and code make advanced features like embeddings accessible as a next step.\n",
      "Learn the words like programmer and software engineer often mean the same thing.\n",
      "So it is larger than the number of items in the vocabulary.\n",
      "And here we see some groups are likely to have high income and others low in code using a feature cross works the same way as before we will cross our age buckets with education and add it to the list of features to use the featured cross can generate many possibilities quickly which is why they are often represented under the hood with the hat.\n",
      "Conveniently, there is a live demo runs in the browser with our census data preloaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person.\n",
      "We had the bucket size feature to the list used to train our model.\n",
      "Come back features of the way you represent your knowledge about the world for the classifier.\n",
      "We use a data set from the US Census as an example.\n",
      "Let is see how represent a categorical feature and I will use the education column as an example because there are only a few values the best way to represent.\n",
      "Like to mention embeddings and these can be less intuitive than the other techniques but there are powerful way to work with categorical data and keep learning settings.\n",
      "If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts.\n",
      "You can think of a truefalse feature being created for each bucket that tells the classifier whether an individual falls into that range.\n",
      "Were building a list of features used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature called this contains data about the come from the CSV file and how to represent it.\n",
      "Crossing is a way to create new features that are combinations of existing ones and these can be especially helpful to linear classifiers, which cannot model interactions between\n",

      "Of course, you could also read the values from a file on disk rather than writing the mountain code.\n",

      "So we put them through sort of very quick sales XnumberX training and then we hired all new hires that cop came coming in or going to have some sort of sailed experience or upselling experience.\n",
      "So what we found out very quickly was and this is it comes in motion talk to anybody in this room.\n",
      "But the more meeting have especially in person meeting the higher the upsell value the way more likely you are going and he built the comp plan.\n",
      "So, of course if you are going to have customer success manager is managing upsells or to come them a little bit more like salespeople.\n",
      "So what we did was we took everyone is bonus structure and instead of making that based on, you know, we Cut the piece that was going to based on renewals and Fern and business effective.\n",
      "This was a quote actually promoting my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsell to you.\n",
      "So basically what we did was we putting in these meeting quotas.\n",

      "Theyre going to want these people want to spend money with people a like if you will they talk to you all the time.\n",
      "So I am going to go ahead and jump the gun here and go a little bit to our results and then I am gonna go back to why we can get work.\n",
      "So within one year of moving all the upselling and focusing on upsell within our group we decrease turn by XnumberX Upsell increase by two hundred and sixtyseven percent and one of the things people always ask me with this is you guys have more resources.\n",
      "We accurate answer is actually probably not because we have a lot more sales people that we have Christmas.\n",
      "So we actually probably decrease the amount of people who are working on these deals and up someone up by XnumberX.\n",
      "We took the sales reps. We already had and we decided we are going to give them sales training.\n",
      "So what we decided was that our client base was actually our biggest opportunity as well as our biggest challenge.\n",
      "So you take a company like Pepsi and we are working with Pepsi or not working with Gatorade and we are not working with Mountain Dew Amazon and all of the different subsidiaries or different business.\n",
      "We were going to rewrite the rules between sales and customer success.\n",
      "So if we close the Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and that we do and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that those to be like a massive opportunities that customer success was not only that relationship instead of sales.\n",
      "This basically to talk a little bit about the strategy when we when we put it in the place that they him XnumberX and taking this opportunity away from sales and putting it.\n",
      "I am sure none of you have ever seen a chart like this, especially since it is been in every presentation that I have gone to you today.\n",
      "So like many of you I am sure what happened with Bentley as we go and we sellable one small piece of information.\n",
      "And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and for everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it.\n",
      "Were going to own all upsells how we defined an upsell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with own that entire parent company relationship.\n",
      "This point over here which corresponds to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars.\n",
      "So we decided at the beginning of XnumberX was that we are going to try something.\n",
      "cluster before alteration=========>\n",
      "So we are going to protecting the error look at the length of the distances from the line to the three points and respond to Simply say the error of this line is the sum of those three read lengths.\n",
      "Were going to try to find the best line that fits through those three points.\n",
      "Well, since we are teaching the computer how to do it computer company, eyeball the line so as to get it to draw a random line, And then see how fast this thing is.\n",
      "I was out we can see that on the XnumberX demos for the word cheap XnumberX of them are spam won five of them are not so these form and XnumberX split.\n",

      "Obviously Best Line subjective, but we try to find a line that works.\n",
      "So in order to see how bad the line is calculate the error.\n",
      "Now we are going to do is multiply around and see if we can reduce this error.\n",
      "We add them up and realize that will increase the error.\n",
      "Let is try moving the other direction over here calculate the error now, it is given by the sum of these three green distances.\n",
      "So let us say we take that step where a little closer to our solution.\n",
      "If we continue doing this procedure several times, we will always be decreasing the error until finally I got a right to a good solution in the form of this line is General procedure is known as gradient descent now in real life, we do not want to deal with negative distances corresponding to point being on one or the other side of the line.\n",
      "Square of the distance from the point of the line step and this procedure is called the least squares.\n",
      "So what I am going to cover the same amount, it will look our surroundings and try to figure out which way we can to send more for example here we can go to directions to the right or to the left.\n",
      "Is equivalent to moving the line downwards and getting farther from the three points we go to the right instead and we are actually descending means of error is decreasing.\n",
      "This is equivalent to move line upwards and getting closer to the three points.\n",
      "This is equivalent to reducing the errors would find its minimum value which gives us the best.\n",
      "Now this method actually much stronger the date of this form a line the very very similar method.\n",
      "The higher we are the larger error is so descending means reducing the error.\n",
      "I think of linear regression is a plane come look at your data and draw the best fitting line.\n",
      "So now in the future the most common can combine these features together spammer not this algorithm is known as the naive Bayes algorithm.\n",
      "So we decided to take a step towards the right then you can start this procedure again and again and again and can be successfully descent on the mountain.\n",
      "We look for the word cheap in all these a hundred emails and find that XnumberX outs families and five of the nuns famines contain that word so we can forget about all the rest of the emails and focused only on the ones that contain the word cheap.\n",
      "So from analyzing this data, we can conclude rule the rule set is, you know contains the word cheap.\n",
      "We can also look at other features and try to find their Associated from physically disabled the could emails containing a spelling mistake and realize that the probability of an email containing a spelling mistake in Spanish XnumberX or listing the Cardinals are missing a title and by the probability of those being spam is XnumberX etc, etc.\n",
      "We have flag XnumberX of them as spam and XnumberX of them is not spam.\n",
      "Now is protecting a feature that spam emails may be likely to display and analyze this features.\n",

      "Easier for the classifier one thing we can do is bucket the feature bucketing transforms numeric feature into several categorical Ones based on the range of falls into and each of these new features indicate where persons aged falls into that range and now a linear model capture the relationship by learning different weights for each bucket.\n",
      "Picture column is one way to efficiently represent the categorical feature with a large vocabulary more importantly you can use these as a way to make your data easier to work with because they free you from having to provide a vocabulary list in this example will represent the occupation column from our CSV file by using a hash XnumberX,XnumberX possible values notice.\n",
      "Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file.\n",

      "If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts.\n",

Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file. Now what can go wrong with this approach? Well, if we think more closely about age we realize it's not in a linear relationship with income the curve might look something like this. It's flat for children than increases during working age and decreases during retirement a linear classifier for example is unable to capture this relationship.

Conveniently, there's a live demo runs in the browser with our census data pre-loaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person. Now let's bucket by age and you can adjust the number of buckets to make it more or less granular how you choose the number of buckets is up to you and ideally you want to use your knowledge of the problem to do this. Well, In tensorflow, we can create a bucket size feature by wrapping a numeric column from the CSV and here we're specifying the number and the ranges of the buckets.

We don't have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions. I said the half size. So it's larger than the number of items in the vocabulary. Here's how this works under the hood. Normally a categorical feature is represented as a 100 coating. That means there's one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance. Now, if we don't know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically. The downside is that could be collisions mean different items are mapped to the same value. Crashes can also be used to limit memory usage at the cost of adding some noise to your training data.

We're looking at a data set of 10,000 words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to 3D so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you'll find similar words are often close together.

But basically what happened was this what are this is what our sales growth numbers look like for 2014 and the conversation started. How are we gonna get there? So what we decided was that our client base was actually our biggest opportunity as well as our biggest challenge. So like many of you I'm sure what happened with Bentley as we go and we sellable one small piece of information. So you take a company like Pepsi and we're working with Pepsi or not working with Gatorade and we're not working with Mountain Dew Amazon and all of the different subsidiaries or different business. So we decided at the beginning of 2014 was that we're going to try something. We were going to rewrite the rules between sales and customer success. And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and for everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it. Basically what we decided to do with that customer success. We're going to own all upsells how we defined an upsell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with own that entire parent company relationship. So if we close the Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and that we do and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that those to be like a massive opportunities that customer success was not only that relationship instead of sales. \"], '2020-02-10T09:27:58Z', 'fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315', 'c3f4a4b8-5750-49ad-81ab-90c6d1fa9a90'], [[\"This basically to talk a little bit about the strategy when we when we put it in the place that they him 2014 and taking this opportunity away from sales and putting it. We took the sales reps. We already had and we decided we're going to give them sales training. So we put them through sort of very quick sales 101 training and then we hired all new hires that cop came coming in or going to have some sort of sailed experience or upselling experience. \"], '2020-02-10T09:29:35Z', 'fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315', '9ae8afc1-e4d5-4ef0-b445-2dfd4213e64d'], [[\"Here are counts based on growth potential. So we might look at a high-growth startup as just as valuable as a GE. We said very aggressive meeting quotas. So what we found out very quickly was and this is it comes in motion talk to anybody in this room. But the more meeting have especially in person meeting the higher the upsell value the way more likely you're going and he built the comp plan. So, of course if you're going to have customer success manager is managing upsells or to come them a little bit more like salespeople. So what we did was we took everyone's bonus structure and instead of making that based on, you know, we Cut the piece that was going to based on renewals and Fern and business effective. So they had that piece and then they also had a commission fees so they could essentially earn as much money as they possibly could with that outsell. So portable. This was a quote actually promoting my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsell to you. So basically what we did was we putting in these meeting quotas. He said like the more you talk to your customers the more you are going to sell. I promise you. The better relationship you have the more money that's going to come in. They're going to want these people want to spend money with people a like if you will they talk to you all the time. Not just people who are helping them in a crisis. So I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun here and go a little bit to our results and then I'm gonna go back to why we can get work. So within one year of moving all the upselling and focusing on upsell within our group we decrease turn by 25% Upsell increase by two hundred and sixty-seven percent and one of the things people always ask me with this is you guys have more resources. We accurate answer is actually probably not because we have a lot more sales people that we have Christmas. That's right. So we actually probably decrease the amount of people who are working on these deals and up someone up by 267. \"], '2020-02-10T09:30:01Z', 'fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315', '1a03ff15-0fe3-4db5-ac21-2287628bb5b2']] \n",

      " Come back features of the way you represent your knowledge about the world for the classifier. And today I'll walk you through techniques you can use to represent your features and utilities tensorflow provides down. We use a data set from the US Census as an example. And the goal is to predict the income is greater than $50,000 based on attributes like their age and occupation. Is that is stored as a CSV file and previously we've seen how to use the column values directly speakers. Today we'll use feature engineering to transform them into a more useful representation as we go on visualize what these Transformations do using a tool called facets and you can find a link to it in the description. You'll also find complete code to train a tensorflow estimator on this data set. Okay, let's get started.  We can use it to predict income. Now. If you think about how we age correlates with income our first intuition if that is aging creases usually sodas income and the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here. We're building a list of features used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature called this contains data about the come from the CSV file and how to represent it. Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file. Now what can go wrong with this approach? Well, if we think more closely about age we realize it's not in a linear relationship with income the curve might look something like this. It's flat for children than increases during working age and decreases during retirement a linear classifier for example is unable to capture this relationship. That's because it learns a single way to reach feature.  Easier for the classifier one thing we can do is bucket the feature bucketing transforms numeric feature into several categorical Ones based on the range of falls into and each of these new features indicate where persons aged falls into that range and now a linear model capture the relationship by learning different weights for each bucket. Let's see how this looks in fastest. Conveniently, there's a live demo runs in the browser with our census data pre-loaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person. Now let's bucket by age and you can adjust the number of buckets to make it more or less granular how you choose the number of buckets is up to you and ideally you want to use your knowledge of the problem to do this. Well, In tensorflow, we can create a bucket size feature by wrapping a numeric column from the CSV and here we're specifying the number and the ranges of the buckets. We'd like created once this is done. We had the bucket size feature to the list used to train our model.  Let's see how represent a categorical feature and I'll use the education column as an example because there are only a few values the best way to represent. This is just to use the robot. And here we'll create a pager call. It says education can be a single value from this list. Of course, you could also read the values from a file on disk rather than writing the mountain code. Now using the wrong value is the right thing to do when they're only a small will cover the case where there are thousands of First let's take a look at feature Crossing.  Crossing is a way to create new features that are combinations of existing ones and these can be especially helpful to linear classifiers, which can't model interactions between  This looks like in passes. I'll take our bait buckets from before and cross them with education under the hood. You can think of a true-false feature being created for each bucket that tells the classifier whether an individual falls into that range. Now, these buttons can be informative. And here we see some groups are likely to have high income and others low in code using a feature cross works the same way as before we'll cross our age buckets with education and add it to the list of features to use the featured cross can generate many possibilities quickly which is why they're often represented under the hood with the hat.  Picture column is one way to efficiently represent the categorical feature with a large vocabulary more importantly you can use these as a way to make your data easier to work with because they free you from having to provide a vocabulary list in this example will represent the occupation column from our CSV file by using a hash 1,000 possible values notice. We don't have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions. I said the half size. So it's larger than the number of items in the vocabulary. Here's how this works under the hood. Normally a categorical feature is represented as a 100 coating. That means there's one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance. Now, if we don't know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically. The downside is that could be collisions mean different items are mapped to the same value. Crashes can also be used to limit memory usage at the cost of adding some noise to your training data. If you have a large vocabulary, it can be memory-intensive to use that as input to a neural network. \n",

      " Enter and product hands and upgrade. I mean a lot of people who really excited about, you know, kind of starting their career as a product manager for when I talk to them. It turns out they have absolutely no idea. What if we mw a lot of people think that a poor manager system as a project manager, you know, some people think that product managers is just like a general manager at think that she has nothing to do with the College funding once and for all I really want to make players what the health of the product managers so you must have heard a lot of people say that a p.m. Is like a mini CEO of his or her products. So what does that actually mean? What what do you mean by saying that someone is the mini see you must have also seen that classic Venn diagram that RPM sits in the middle of business tag and user experience again, you know, that's more. Jargon unless you kind of understand what that so p.m. In my opinion that is required to ship a quality product sitting right in Broad terms. It can be broken down into Is there a market research business strategy and business modeling finding a great user experience by a product getting the product built from a technical point of view and then finally taking the product to market. The first thing that a p.m. Does is understanding the user and understanding the market right as a p.m. You're building a great product for your users. You're trying to solve problems or use it right? So understanding the user is out for parts of what a BMW. How does it to be em do it? Well, there are multiple ways, you know, people do surveys people do interviews people to sit with the users and see how they're using the product people just look at data to see how users are using the product. There are multiple ways of how you actually go and in-depth understand your users, but that's really a really large part of your role is here. the second thing that the PM does is build a solid understanding of the market and  In a lot of scenarios to understand why user should use your product and not a competitor's product. You need to understand the market in and out and what YouTube editor offers as state abbreviations, especially be scenario the competitor could mean a big difference between winning the sale or losing the next Simone thing that IBM does in her role is build a great strategy by product and tie it back to the bottom of it. Remember that you're trying to build a great product for users. But your item id gold for your company is also increase the profits on the revenue or the engagement whatever the key metrics are for your company. So it's very important that the PM invest time in understanding for company's business model and making sure that the strategy she's building for her product is in line with that business models for now comes the really exciting thing. The first thing that a p.m. Spends a lot of time doing is actually defining the experience for our I love you. Once you've defined your problem by understanding users understanding your Market thinking about the business model Etc. The next step is the actually cycle step which is now figuring out a solution for that problem typically is the steps involved in this solution or product design phase our first writing a strategy or a vision for your product. Like what do you want to achieve with this product? The Second Step then is figuring out a user flow for how you want to solve the problem. Depending on the size of the company all the type of the company working at you have a team of designers to help you with that. What this process involves is first building a wireframe. Think about wireframe as like a blueprint of a building that an architecture has its to help you visualize how the user for will work for your project. Once you kind of nailed on your right brain. The next step is building a prototype which in layman's term is like a working model of your products.  When data prototype back to users have them play around with it and then give you feedback here. The reviews is take the feed bags and kind of to the process again, unless you till you feel that you've kind of hit the nail on the head and I'm ready to move on to the next stage of actually participate. So now comes the build phase which is the grunt work with. \n",

      " Home can be used to limit the maximum number of possibilities, but I prefer them simply as a tool to save you program time.  Like to mention embeddings and these can be less intuitive than the other techniques but there are powerful way to work with categorical data and keep learning settings. You can think of an embedding as a vector that represents the meaning of a word and we can visualize the data set word embeddings using the tensorflow embedding projector and there's an online demo you can find in the description here. We're looking at a data set of 10,000 words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to 3D so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you'll find similar words are often close together. For example, all of the words in this cluster cities what's neat about weddings is that they're learned automatically process of training a DNA and to make that happen. All you need to do is write that column here will create a wedding for Education 10 Dimensions. Now embeddings are helpful. If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts. Rather than memorizing the meaning of specific words, for example. Imagine if the Census Data had a column called job title. There are thousands of different jobs and an embedding could be used to help your classifier. Learn the words like programmer and software engineer often mean the same thing.  I hope this was a helpful intro and thinking about how to represent features. It's one of the most important contributions you can make to machine learning experiment feature columns are great because they let you experiment with different representations and code make advanced features like embeddings accessible as a next step. I recommend you try to code in description and see if you can modify it for problem. You care about Thanks for watching everyone and I'll see you next time. \n",

Yeah, natural language how each other in ways that are natural sounds good. So I want to start by talking a little bit about your area of research and kind of the general natural language processing field and then we'll delve into your area of research see where our competition Keeps Us. Yeah. That sounds great. So broadly speaking. The area of my research is natural language processing or NLP and what that is out and up. He is all about trying to understand how humans can communicate with each other and how to get a computer to kind of replicate that behavior so that we can interact with computers in a more natural manner. Wow, you guys really think this small people? Yeah. I know this sounds Super Bra. Yeah. It's like everything. Yeah, it's pretty dried. So So in fact, like I have some slides. Yeah, that'd be that'd be great. Yeah. Yeah. So first I think it begins approach to talk about the conversational user interface and for something like the Google Assistant. There's two big domains of NLP problems that come into play on one side. You have a bump of understanding which is one of these are saying what was the users intent and on the other side you have the problem of generation for Choice one should be saved user and how do we  Either way that's intelligent and conversation. Right? So I work on the generation side and the ultimate goal of natural language generation is to teach computers to turn some kind of structured data into natural language, which we can use to respond to the user in a conversation one of them. Then this is definitely something that I feel like conventionally NLP has really been probably thought about as a field where it's all about processing the works and understanding what What techniques but you are working on a generation set which a lot of ways often gets overlooked. So it's really great that you're but I can't tell us more about this side of things. Yeah, that's what I'm here for. So how do you then teach a computer to generate a file and read and write so for now, let's set our site the structure data part of natural language generation. \n",

This presentation assumes that you're at least somewhat familiar with agile software development, which is an iterative and incremental start development process that focuses on self-organizing cross-functional teams.  Familiar with that software development. There's a crossroad of books and internet sites that you can peruse at your leisure. The southern keeps to being a great agile product manager our vision ownership Independence decisiveness availability verification and flexibility, but a little bit more about me and why qualified I feel to be talking about this. I've been doing agile software development for over 11 years and have been a part of dozens of agile projects. everything from one person startups in Silicon Valley to large bureaucratic organizations at which some of which were internet companies others more traditional companies such as insurance companies. So I'm kind of seeing the gamut of agile projects and I've always been an engineer. So why me, I'm in the trenches software developer and Coach. I taking this opportunity because I really want to speak sort of from the horse's mouth.  Managers about how they can better serve their engineering team and how their engineering team can better serve them. I think a lot of people who give seminars and and time presentations such as I sort of giving it to their peers. I think it's important for people who have more might be more quote unquote business side of the organization to hear directly from those technical side of the organization, but how How they can work together better.  Give practical pragmatic day-to-day advice how to work with your agile Engineers. Yes. It's about helping you. But also it's about me being selfish. I like to code and coach and time coding and coaching at least 80% of the time than not as happy as I could be might not be as effective.  Case let's go through them Vision over documents as Engineers. We need an enthusiastic figurehead for the project person that really encapsulates embodies. The reason that we're developing this product. What we don't need is a big document that we have to reference all the time or that you have to reference all the time. We're smart people we read but what we do often lack that we can't get out of a document is product Vision sort of that the themes principles and guidelines for why we're even directly creating this product. We're looking to you to be the physical embodiment of this project. If you have great vision for the project, you can also have great ownership over it. We want this to be your baby. Not just one more thing for you to manage one more thing on your checklist. We are looking for a single point of contact and we don't want to have to run all of it organization trying to figure out get a question answered or something like that. We're looking for you to meet that figurehead and also that person who is ultimately responsible for getting the product delivered. We want know you have skin in the game Independence over Bianca.

      " We're going to talk about today is what is machine learning? Well, this is the world and world. We got humans and we have computers and one of the main differences between humans and computers is a humans learn from past experience. Whereas computers need to be told what to do they to be program. So they follow instructions. Now the question is can we get computers to learn from experience to and the answer is yes, we can and that's precisely what machine learning is. Of course for computers past experiences have a name of data. So in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you a few examples in which we can teach the computer how to learn from previous data and most importantly I'm going to show you that these algorithms are actually pretty easy and the Machine learning is really nothing to fear. \n",

      " Let's go to the first example. Let's say we're starting the housing market and our task is to predict the price of a house given its size. So we have a small house that cost $70,000. We have a big house that costs a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and we'd like to estimate the price of this medium sized house here. So, how do we do it? Well first put them in the grave where the x-axis represents the size of the house and square feet and the y-axis represents a price of the house in dollars. And so to help us out, we have collected some previous data. And the more of these blue dots. These are other houses that we've looked at every record at their prices with respect to their size. So we this graph we can see that the small house is priced $70,000 and the big house is priced at $160,000. So now it's time for a small quiz. What do you think best guess for the price of the museum house given this data with the $8,000 $120,000 or $190,000?  Help us out we can see that these Blue Points kind of form a line so we can draw the line that best fits the data around this line. We can say that our best guess for the price of the house. This point over here which corresponds to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars. So if you said $120,000, that is correct. This method is known as the linear regression. Why you may ask?  And excited to be here today. So today I'm going to be talking about land and expand philosophy that we've embraced at Billy and I know this is sort of something that a lot of people talk about and sort of who owns upsell and cross-sell relationship to get larger that can sometimes become the tension between sales and success game. So we're going to talk about a little bit about how it is. Did it happen today? So real quick a little bit of background about me. So I'm the director of customer set that bit me. I we are based in New York. And have been that way for about two and a half years is to make something like this oldest employee of Italy at the moment. So I feel like I've been around the block a few times. So my team we've got about and got seven people on the team right now. We're hiring aggressively and then just a little bit about that lie so that Li you guys all probably know busy in some capacity of not go on Twitter and the person is palpable the Ability Link. I'm sure but we were establishing 2008 to solve like a very real problem on the web which was that link for too long the books. So pretty basic there when it's painted in about 60 employees three offices you want differences again with about 1,200 Enterprise clients. So the first question I always get when I say that I'm a director customers accessibility is how to Simply make money and what does it mean that you manage accounts up lately? A lot of people don't realize that we have an Enterprise product. We have about 1200 Enterprise customers. We've got 9 million freezes and both of those will let me to the customer success team which presenting challenges and of itself. We kind of the size and scale of Italy is also interesting. So we short about 600 million weeks and months see about eight to nine billion clicks and I'm about 2 billion aggressive Target. There's a little bit of background sort of understand the size and scale. So now I'm basically just going to take you guys through the story of like what we did Billy nothing. It's like the right model of the wrong model. Definitely a different model than most people and it can be a little bit controversial at times when I talk about this. So to take a step back as a beginning of 2013. \n",

      " And we were in saved for 2014 planning now. I'm sure none of you have ever seen a chart like this, especially since it's been in every presentation that I've gone to you today. But basically what happened was this what are this is what our sales growth numbers look like for 2014 and the conversation started. How are we gonna get there? So what we decided was that our client base was actually our biggest opportunity as well as our biggest challenge. So like many of you I'm sure what happened with Bentley as we go and we sellable one small piece of information. So you take a company like Pepsi and we're working with Pepsi or not working with Gatorade and we're not working with Mountain Dew Amazon and all of the different subsidiaries or different business. So we decided at the beginning of 2014 was that we're going to try something. We were going to rewrite the rules between sales and customer success. And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and for everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it. Basically what we decided to do with that customer success. We're going to own all upsells how we defined an upsell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with own that entire parent company relationship. So if we close the Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and that we do and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that those to be like a massive opportunities that customer success was not only that relationship instead of sales.  This basically to talk a little bit about the strategy when we when we put it in the place that they him 2014 and taking this opportunity away from sales and putting it. We took the sales reps. We already had and we decided we're going to give them sales training. So we put them through sort of very quick sales 101 training and then we hired all new hires that cop came coming in or going to have some sort of sailed experience or upselling experience.  Here are counts based on growth potential. So we might look at a high-growth startup as just as valuable as a GE. We said very aggressive meeting quotas. So what we found out very quickly was and this is it comes in motion talk to anybody in this room. But the more meeting have especially in person meeting the higher the upsell value the way more likely you're going and he built the comp plan. So, of course if you're going to have customer success manager is managing upsells or to come them a little bit more like salespeople. So what we did was we took everyone's bonus structure and instead of making that based on, you know, we Cut the piece that was going to based on renewals and Fern and business effective. So they had that piece and then they also had a commission fees so they could essentially earn as much money as they possibly could with that outsell. So portable. This was a quote actually promoting my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsell to you. So basically what we did was we putting in these meeting quotas. He said like the more you talk to your customers the more you are going to sell. I promise you. The better relationship you have the more money that's going to come in. They're going to want these people want to spend money with people a like if you will they talk to you all the time. Not just people who are helping them in a crisis. So I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun here and go a little bit to our results and then I'm gonna go back to why we can get work. So within one year of moving all the upselling and focusing on upsell within our group we decrease turn by 25% Upsell increase by two hundred and sixty-seven percent and one of the things people always ask me with this is you guys have more resources. We accurate answer is actually probably not because we have a lot more sales people that we have Christmas. That's right. So we actually probably decrease the amount of people who are working on these deals and up someone up by 267. \n",

      " Look at a simple example this three points. We're going to try to find the best line that fits through those three points. Obviously Best Line subjective, but we try to find a line that works. Well, since we're teaching the computer how to do it computer company, eyeball the line so as to get it to draw a random line, And then see how fast this thing is. So in order to see how bad the line is calculate the error. So we're going to protecting the error look at the length of the distances from the line to the three points and respond to Simply say the error of this line is the sum of those three read lengths. Now we're going to do is multiply around and see if we can reduce this error. So let's say we move in this direction. And we calculate the error given by the yellow distances. We add them up and realize that will increase the error. So that's not a good direction to go. Let's try moving the other direction over here calculate the error now, it's given by the sum of these three green distances. And we see that the error is smaller. So we actually reduced it. So let's say we take that step where a little closer to our solution. If we continue doing this procedure several times, we will always be decreasing the error until finally I got a right to a good solution in the form of this line is General procedure is known as gradient descent now in real life, we don't want to deal with negative distances corresponding to point being on one or the other side of the line. So we do to solve this is ad. Square of the distance from the point of the line step and this procedure is called the least squares.  It really sad the front of the central Mountain. These are mountain Mount Everest this mounting. The higher we are the larger error is so descending means reducing the error. So what I'm going to cover the same amount, it will look our surroundings and try to figure out which way we can to send more for example here we can go to directions to the right or to the left. Go to Left you're not insert errors ascending. Is equivalent to moving the line downwards and getting farther from the three points we go to the right instead and we're actually descending means of error is decreasing. This is equivalent to move line upwards and getting closer to the three points. So we decided to take a step towards the right then you can start this procedure again and again and again and can be successfully descent on the mountain. This is equivalent to reducing the errors would find its minimum value which gives us the best. Best Line fit  I think of linear regression is a plane come look at your data and draw the best fitting line. Now this method actually much stronger the date of this form a line the very very similar method. We draw Circle three. Or a parabola or even a higher degree curve. For example the data here. We can actually get a cubic polynomial. \n",

      " Hi everyone. Welcome to this week's product School talk as you guys know, we teach product management coding and data courses that are six campuses. You guys can find more information on that in private school the.com today. We have a very special guest with us. He's done an AMA in our slack Community with us before and it was awesome and he has a lot to share with you today guys. So I'd like to welcome Kenneth Berger the very first product manager for slack. Welcome. Tennis are you doing Today, I'm doing great. Thanks for having me. Awesome. Well, we're really really excited to have you today. I know you have a presentation set up. So I'm going to give you a couple minutes to start screen sharing their and think so. All right. I'm on it. Awesome. So Kenneth is well, he's sharing that and getting that set up just so you guys know we're going to take questions after his presentation. So we'll have about 7 to 10 minutes for that and And you guys can just type of right next to the the YouTube link. So if Allah let you take it from here. Aw, thanks Sandra. So hi everybody, it's very nice of you to have me I had a ton of fun doing that Am A and B. So a few months back so excited to share a little bit more about what I learned at slack. It's definitely an interesting time for me.  All probably know in slacks been on pretty amazing Run for the past few years. And of course the question that everyone asks me is how do they do it? Right? What was what's the secret sauce? What was the thing that sort of made that growth? So explosive event, and I'm always a little disappointed. Well, yeah, there is no secret sauce that said here. What we did is slack and what the culture was right there. So what we get is other companies that I work for. The really were a few things that I hover notable and different and worth sharing. So especially in the wake of leaving. I wanted to make sure that I shared that stuff.  I want to jump in a little bit of an introduction. So these days I'm an executive coach. So I took my passion for helping people grow and the coaching world started doing that for the past couple of years. I work with CEO ctOS early and mid-stage companies as well as product managers for that. I was in probably manager for temples yours and slack Joby for a long time and I was a Founder as well. So I kind of see the whole life cycle of a product from foundings. oath to the church  I wanted to chat in folks about is this idea that I call Peaks and valleys? And this is really inspired by the questions that I start getting and once I started working for slag because you know, he would say the most amazing things I was so it was so gratifying to see o swag is so well designed so polished so wonderful, because from my perspective I was the BF right? My job was see all those wrong product by all the things that were not there at all or that were had serious room for improvement or Whatever it was and so I started to think about how do I rationalize these two things? All the problems are the areas of improvement. I see in a product and have I rationalized that with all this positive feedback. And what I realized was that really slack head Peaks and valleys and what I mean by that is that it had areas the product sure that we're missing right pieces of the vision that we had gotten to yet other than word especially polish, but it also Also had peace and those Peaks were places where we live above and beyond where we really sort of gave a little bit extra and that's that's what people remember it, right? They weren't noticing all that other stuff. That wasn't quite all extra wasn't quite there. They are remembering the things where we went a little bit above and beyond to make the product better to sort of show you really care and it's powerful idea.  what I mean by that is, you know, it's a lot of people are really using this idea of the MVP right the minimum viable product of the problem with building a minimum is that you're going above and beyond anywhere or if you're doing an absolute minimum and every area product and if you're only doing the demo How are people going to remember right? What's going to stand out in their mind straight a year from now or even next week right when you're trying to remember? Oh, yeah, what was that product I tried. And I actually use this Photograph here to illustrate that because I drew this for my photo library in photos. I'm taking on vacation, but I'm clearly I cared about it enough to take a picture and save it but I can't remember now. We're this is what country it is. Even what your the trip was on. I don't remember whether I was car like train I mean, so it's pretty right that was pretty enough to take the picture and serving its purpose in some sense, but The memorability is much lacking right now build a flat product which would take the picture that's good, but not particularly notable. Anyway, you're not necessarily doing it not you're not doing what the product is. \n",

      " Tell me this a hundred emails. We have flag 25 of them as spam and 75 of them is not spam. Now is protecting a feature that spam emails may be likely to display and analyze this features. So what future could be containing the word cheap. Seems reasonable to think that an email containing the word cheap is likely to be spam. So let's analyze this claim. We look for the word cheap in all these a hundred emails and find that 20 outs families and five of the nuns famines contain that word so we can forget about all the rest of the emails and focused only on the ones that contain the word cheap. Okay, so time for a quiz. Here's the question. based on our data If an email contains the word cheap, what is the probability of this email being scammed? Is it 40% 60% or 80%  I was out we can see that on the 25 demos for the word cheap 20 of them are spam won five of them are not so these form and 80/20 split. So the correct answer was eight. You said 80 were correct? So from analyzing this data, we can conclude rule the rule set is, you know contains the word cheap. Then we're going to say the probability of it being spent is 80% so we can associate this feature with the probability percent and we're going to use it like future messages as spam or not spam. We can also look at other features and try to find their Associated from physically disabled the could emails containing a spelling mistake and realize that the probability of an email containing a spelling mistake in Spanish 70% or listing the Cardinals are missing a title and by the probability of those being spam is 95% etc, etc. So now in the future the most common can combine these features together spammer not this algorithm is known as the naive Bayes algorithm. \n",

So to each user we're going to try to recommend them the app that they are most likely to download. We have gathered a table of data that we're going to use to make the rules and the table contains six people for each one of those six people were recorded their gender and their age and the app downloaded. So for example, The first person is 15 year old female downloaded Pokemon go.  Always between gender and age which was seems like the more decisive feature for predicting what Apple the users download?  Help us out first. Let's look at gender. It was written by gender than the females downloaded Pokemon. Go in WhatsApp, whereas the male is downloaded Pokemon go on Snapchat. So not much of a split here on the other hand if we look at age, we realize that everybody who's hundred twenty years old download Pokemon Gold whereas everybody who is 20 or older didn't that's a nice split. So the feature the best splits the data is H there for you. He said age. That was correct. So we're going to do is run a question here. The question is are you younger than 20? If yes, then we'll recommend Pokemon go to you. If not, then we'll see. So what happens if you're 20 or older then we look at the gender. It seems like here if you're a female you've downloaded. What's up, if your mail, it's downloaded Snap Chat. So we had another question here. The question is are you female or male or female? We recommend what's up and if your mail and recommend Snapchat?  The end up here is with the decision tree and the decisions are given by the question. We asked. And this decision tree was built with the datum. Now whenever we have a new user we can put them to the position tree and recommend them whatever happened we suggest is to recommend. For example, they have a young person. You recommend them for C'Mon go. If you have an older person you check their gender. It's a female you're recommending what's up, and it's a male the recommend Snapchat. \n",

So for instance, this is a reference book countries fact that I've sizes is hardback has high picture to word ratio. and random access  Thanks for transtion. Please explain what features means providing the link to the benefits for instance because it's hard back. It's hard wearing or the high picture to word ratio means there are small simple information which can be easily diverland. All the random access means you can open the book anywhere and information b stands for benefits benefits trigger the emotional element of the process. Yes, and they are the things that motivate a sale. They are not generally priced ribbon so customers it's the what's in it for me benefits obviously change according to each individual. So this is where you have to listen to your customers needs. I think about what the advantages means to your aftermath an example might be a customer is purchasing for a child with The Reluctant reader, but who loves science so the It's the best book are that it's a favorite topic and the random access combined with the high picture to word ratio means it would be perfect for confidence building and learning by cells. Learning to use Fab does take practice. However, it will expand your knowledge and confidence resulting in a better service for your customers. There are tools on the website which can support you that are selling the starter kit information sheet and the new title information sheet are great resources that enable you to pull out the features advantages and benefits without having seen We booked the key selling point feet will also help kids as it lists, 16 features and advantages. Remember the books on the starter kit showcased best sellers across the range enabling you to cross-sell.  Polly is talking about books that might complement purchase for example in this instance with a hundred things about science. A science experiment book might be a great cross sell or you might cross sell a title from the same way, but about different topics. For instance. I'm just things to know about space. Upselling is where yourself looks have higher values than the original book knowing about your story collections gift sets box sets and compendiums is useful and upselling in this example. You might upsell by introducing the Science Encyclopedia. \n",

      " Come back features of the way you represent your knowledge about the world for the classifier. And today I'll walk you through techniques you can use to represent your features and utilities tensorflow provides down. We use a data set from the US Census as an example. And the goal is to predict the income is greater than $50,000 based on attributes like their age and occupation. Is that is stored as a CSV file and previously we've seen how to use the column values directly speakers. Today we'll use feature engineering to transform them into a more useful representation as we go on visualize what these Transformations do using a tool called facets and you can find a link to it in the description. You'll also find complete code to train a tensorflow estimator on this data set. Okay, let's get started.  We can use it to predict income. Now. If you think about how we age correlates with income our first intuition if that is aging creases usually sodas income and the simplest way to represent this just be to take the raw numeric value and use that as a feature here. We're building a list of features used to train the model and each of these is stored as a feature called this contains data about the come from the CSV file and how to represent it. Here, we write a feature that just uses the raw value of H. And this string corresponds to a column in the CSV file. Now what can go wrong with this approach? Well, if we think more closely about age we realize it's not in a linear relationship with income the curve might look something like this. It's flat for children than increases during working age and decreases during retirement a linear classifier for example is unable to capture this relationship. That's because it learns a single way to reach feature.  Easier for the classifier one thing we can do is bucket the feature bucketing transforms numeric feature into several categorical Ones based on the range of falls into and each of these new features indicate where persons aged falls into that range and now a linear model capture the relationship by learning different weights for each bucket. Let's see how this looks in fastest. Conveniently, there's a live demo runs in the browser with our census data pre-loaded and each individual from CSV is visualized as a DOT colored by income if you click on a DOT, you can see stats about the person. Now let's bucket by age and you can adjust the number of buckets to make it more or less granular how you choose the number of buckets is up to you and ideally you want to use your knowledge of the problem to do this. Well, In tensorflow, we can create a bucket size feature by wrapping a numeric column from the CSV and here we're specifying the number and the ranges of the buckets. We'd like created once this is done. We had the bucket size feature to the list used to train our model.  Let's see how represent a categorical feature and I'll use the education column as an example because there are only a few values the best way to represent. This is just to use the robot. And here we'll create a pager call. It says education can be a single value from this list. Of course, you could also read the values from a file on disk rather than writing the mountain code. Now using the wrong value is the right thing to do when they're only a small will cover the case where there are thousands of First let's take a look at feature Crossing.  Crossing is a way to create new features that are combinations of existing ones and these can be especially helpful to linear classifiers, which can't model interactions between  This looks like in passes. I'll take our bait buckets from before and cross them with education under the hood. You can think of a true-false feature being created for each bucket that tells the classifier whether an individual falls into that range. Now, these buttons can be informative. And here we see some groups are likely to have high income and others low in code using a feature cross works the same way as before we'll cross our age buckets with education and add it to the list of features to use the featured cross can generate many possibilities quickly which is why they're often represented under the hood with the hat.  Picture column is one way to efficiently represent the categorical feature with a large vocabulary more importantly you can use these as a way to make your data easier to work with because they free you from having to provide a vocabulary list in this example will represent the occupation column from our CSV file by using a hash 1,000 possible values notice. We don't have to provide the vocabulary list and to avoid collisions. I said the half size. So it's larger than the number of items in the vocabulary. Here's how this works under the hood. Normally a categorical feature is represented as a 100 coating. That means there's one bit for each possible value in the vocabulary and we can create a lookup because we know the vocabulary list in advance. Now, if we don't know the vocab we can use a hash function to compute the bit automatically. The downside is that could be collisions mean different items are mapped to the same value. Crashes can also be used to limit memory usage at the cost of adding some noise to your training data. If you have a large vocabulary, it can be memory-intensive to use that as input to a neural network. \n",

      " So now another example we are the app store or Google play. Our goal is to recommend apps to users. So to each user we're going to try to recommend them the app that they are most likely to download. We have gathered a table of data that we're going to use to make the rules and the table contains six people for each one of those six people were recorded their gender and their age and the app downloaded. So for example, The first person is 15 year old female downloaded Pokemon go.  Always between gender and age which was seems like the more decisive feature for predicting what Apple the users download?  Help us out first. Let's look at gender. It was written by gender than the females downloaded Pokemon. Go in WhatsApp, whereas the male is downloaded Pokemon go on Snapchat. So not much of a split here on the other hand if we look at age, we realize that everybody who's hundred twenty years old download Pokemon Gold whereas everybody who is 20 or older didn't that's a nice split. So the feature the best splits the data is H there for you. He said age. That was correct. So we're going to do is run a question here. The question is are you younger than 20? If yes, then we'll recommend Pokemon go to you. If not, then we'll see. So what happens if you're 20 or older then we look at the gender. It seems like here if you're a female you've downloaded. What's up, if your mail, it's downloaded Snap Chat. So we had another question here. The question is are you female or male or female? We recommend what's up and if your mail and recommend Snapchat?  The end up here is with the decision tree and the decisions are given by the question. We asked. And this decision tree was built with the datum. Now whenever we have a new user we can put them to the position tree and recommend them whatever happened we suggest is to recommend. For example, they have a young person. You recommend them for C'Mon go. If you have an older person you check their gender. It's a female you're recommending what's up, and it's a male the recommend Snapchat. \n",

      " Look at a simple example this three points. We're going to try to find the best line that fits through those three points. Obviously Best Line subjective, but we try to find a line that works. Well, since we're teaching the computer how to do it computer company, eyeball the line so as to get it to draw a random line, And then see how fast this thing is. So in order to see how bad the line is calculate the error. So we're going to protecting the error look at the length of the distances from the line to the three points and respond to Simply say the error of this line is the sum of those three read lengths. Now we're going to do is multiply around and see if we can reduce this error. So let's say we move in this direction. And we calculate the error given by the yellow distances. We add them up and realize that will increase the error. So that's not a good direction to go. Let's try moving the other direction over here calculate the error now, it's given by the sum of these three green distances. And we see that the error is smaller. So we actually reduced it. So let's say we take that step where a little closer to our solution. If we continue doing this procedure several times, we will always be decreasing the error until finally I got a right to a good solution in the form of this line is General procedure is known as gradient descent now in real life, we don't want to deal with negative distances corresponding to point being on one or the other side of the line. So we do to solve this is ad. Square of the distance from the point of the line step and this procedure is called the least squares.  It really sad the front of the central Mountain. These are mountain Mount Everest this mounting. The higher we are the larger error is so descending means reducing the error. So what I'm going to cover the same amount, it will look our surroundings and try to figure out which way we can to send more for example here we can go to directions to the right or to the left. Go to Left you're not insert errors ascending. Is equivalent to moving the line downwards and getting farther from the three points we go to the right instead and we're actually descending means of error is decreasing. This is equivalent to move line upwards and getting closer to the three points. So we decided to take a step towards the right then you can start this procedure again and again and again and can be successfully descent on the mountain. This is equivalent to reducing the errors would find its minimum value which gives us the best. Best Line fit  I think of linear regression is a plane come look at your data and draw the best fitting line. Now this method actually much stronger the date of this form a line the very very similar method. We draw Circle three. Or a parabola or even a higher degree curve. For example the data here. We can actually get a cubic polynomial. \n",

So what future could be containing the word cheap. Seems reasonable to think that an email containing the word cheap is likely to be spam. So let's analyze this claim. We look for the word cheap in all these a hundred emails and find that 20 outs families and five of the nuns famines contain that word so we can forget about all the rest of the emails and focused only on the ones that contain the word cheap. Okay, so time for a quiz. Here's the question. based on our data If an email contains the word cheap, what is the probability of this email being scammed? Is it 40% 60% or 80%  I was out we can see that on the 25 demos for the word cheap 20 of them are spam won five of them are not so these form and 80/20 split. So the correct answer was eight. You said 80 were correct? So from analyzing this data, we can conclude rule the rule set is, you know contains the word cheap. Then we're going to say the probability of it being spent is 80% so we can associate this feature with the probability percent and we're going to use it like future messages as spam or not spam. We can also look at other features and try to find their Associated from physically disabled the could emails containing a spelling mistake and realize that the probability of an email containing a spelling mistake in Spanish 70% or listing the Cardinals are missing a title and by the probability of those being spam is 95% etc, etc. So now in the future the most common can combine these features together spammer not this algorithm is known as the naive Bayes algorithm. \n",

      " Setting up for books a great technique to sell these beautiful books is to use a Fab selling method F stands for features of your product. So for instance, this is a reference book countries fact that I've sizes is hardback has high picture to word ratio. and random access  Thanks for transtion. Please explain what features means providing the link to the benefits for instance because it's hard back. It's hard wearing or the high picture to word ratio means there are small simple information which can be easily diverland. All the random access means you can open the book anywhere and information b stands for benefits benefits trigger the emotional element of the process. Yes, and they are the things that motivate a sale. They are not generally priced ribbon so customers it's the what's in it for me benefits obviously change according to each individual. So this is where you have to listen to your customers needs. I think about what the advantages means to your aftermath an example might be a customer is purchasing for a child with The Reluctant reader, but who loves science so the It's the best book are that it's a favorite topic and the random access combined with the high picture to word ratio means it would be perfect for confidence building and learning by cells. Learning to use Fab does take practice. However, it will expand your knowledge and confidence resulting in a better service for your customers. There are tools on the website which can support you that are selling the starter kit information sheet and the new title information sheet are great resources that enable you to pull out the features advantages and benefits without having seen We booked the key selling point feet will also help kids as it lists, 16 features and advantages. Remember the books on the starter kit showcased best sellers across the range enabling you to cross-sell.  Polly is talking about books that might complement purchase for example in this instance with a hundred things about science. A science experiment book might be a great cross sell or you might cross sell a title from the same way, but about different topics. For instance. I'm just things to know about space. Upselling is where yourself looks have higher values than the original book knowing about your story collections gift sets box sets and compendiums is useful and upselling in this example. You might upsell by introducing the Science Encyclopedia. \n",

      " Let's go to the first example. Let's say we're starting the housing market and our task is to predict the price of a house given its size. So we have a small house that cost $70,000. We have a big house that costs a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and we'd like to estimate the price of this medium sized house here. So, how do we do it? Well first put them in the grave where the x-axis represents the size of the house and square feet and the y-axis represents a price of the house in dollars. And so to help us out, we have collected some previous data. And the more of these blue dots. These are other houses that we've looked at every record at their prices with respect to their size. So we this graph we can see that the small house is priced $70,000 and the big house is priced at $160,000. So now it's time for a small quiz. What do you think best guess for the price of the museum house given this data with the $8,000 $120,000 or $190,000?  Help us out we can see that these Blue Points kind of form a line so we can draw the line that best fits the data around this line. We can say that our best guess for the price of the house. This point over here which corresponds to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars. So if you said $120,000, that is correct. This method is known as the linear regression. Why you may ask?  And excited to be here today. So today I'm going to be talking about land and expand philosophy that we've embraced at Billy and I know this is sort of something that a lot of people talk about and sort of who owns upsell and cross-sell relationship to get larger that can sometimes become the tension between sales and success game. So we're going to talk about a little bit about how it is. Did it happen today? So real quick a little bit of background about me. So I'm the director of customer set that bit me. I we are based in New York. And have been that way for about two and a half years is to make something like this oldest employee of Italy at the moment. So I feel like I've been around the block a few times. So my team we've got about and got seven people on the team right now. We're hiring aggressively and then just a little bit about that lie so that Li you guys all probably know busy in some capacity of not go on Twitter and the person is palpable the Ability Link. I'm sure but we were establishing 2008 to solve like a very real problem on the web which was that link for too long the books. So pretty basic there when it's painted in about 60 employees three offices you want differences again with about 1,200 Enterprise clients. So the first question I always get when I say that I'm a director customers accessibility is how to Simply make money and what does it mean that you manage accounts up lately? A lot of people don't realize that we have an Enterprise product. We have about 1200 Enterprise customers. We've got 9 million freezes and both of those will let me to the customer success team which presenting challenges and of itself. We kind of the size and scale of Italy is also interesting. So we short about 600 million weeks and months see about eight to nine billion clicks and I'm about 2 billion aggressive Target. There's a little bit of background sort of understand the size and scale. So now I'm basically just going to take you guys through the story of like what we did Billy nothing. It's like the right model of the wrong model. Definitely a different model than most people and it can be a little bit controversial at times when I talk about this. So to take a step back as a beginning of 2013. \n",

      " Home can be used to limit the maximum number of possibilities, but I prefer them simply as a tool to save you program time.  Like to mention embeddings and these can be less intuitive than the other techniques but there are powerful way to work with categorical data and keep learning settings. You can think of an embedding as a vector that represents the meaning of a word and we can visualize the data set word embeddings using the tensorflow embedding projector and there's an online demo you can find in the description here. We're looking at a data set of 10,000 words Each of which is represented by a vector with many dimensions projected down to 3D so we can see them you can search for words in the Box to the right and if you experiment it, you'll find similar words are often close together. For example, all of the words in this cluster cities what's neat about weddings is that they're learned automatically process of training a DNA and to make that happen. All you need to do is write that column here will create a wedding for Education 10 Dimensions. Now embeddings are helpful. If you have a categorical column with a large vocabulary and you want to compress the representation so the classifier learns general concepts. Rather than memorizing the meaning of specific words, for example. Imagine if the Census Data had a column called job title. There are thousands of different jobs and an embedding could be used to help your classifier. Learn the words like programmer and software engineer often mean the same thing.  I hope this was a helpful intro and thinking about how to represent features. It's one of the most important contributions you can make to machine learning experiment feature columns are great because they let you experiment with different representations and code make advanced features like embeddings accessible as a next step. I recommend you try to code in description and see if you can modify it for problem. You care about Thanks for watching everyone and I'll see you next time. \n",

It can even learn to play video games by forming patterns of the pixels as they appear on the screen when learning, what is the best action to take when it seizes her pattern CNN can learn to play video games in some cases are better than human.  I believe that if you take a couple of CNN's have them set to watching YouTube videos one can learn objects again patterns. The other one can learn types of graphs this day. The couple was other execution software. Hey II Ventures we're joined in the studio by John example Google research into you and Justin. Thanks for joining us. You today? Yeah, natural language how each other in ways that are natural sounds good. So I want to start by talking a little bit about your area of research and kind of the general natural language processing field and then we'll delve into your area of research see where our competition Keeps Us. Yeah. That sounds great. So broadly speaking. The area of my research is natural language processing or NLP and what that is out and up. He is all about trying to understand how humans can communicate with each other and how to get a computer to kind of replicate that behavior so that we can interact with computers in a more natural manner. Wow, you guys really think this small people? Yeah. I know this sounds Super Bra. Yeah. It's like everything. Yeah, it's pretty dried. So So in fact, like I have some slides. Yeah, that'd be that'd be great. Yeah. Yeah. So first I think it begins approach to talk about the conversational user interface and for something like the Google Assistant. There's two big domains of NLP problems that come into play on one side. You have a bump of understanding which is one of these are saying what was the users intent and on the other side you have the problem of generation for Choice one should be saved user and how do we  Either way that's intelligent and conversation. Right? So I work on the generation side and the ultimate goal of natural language generation is to teach computers to turn some kind of structured data into natural language, which we can use to respond to the user in a conversation one of them. Then this is definitely something that I feel like conventionally NLP has really been probably thought about as a field where it's all about processing the works and understanding what What techniques but you are working on a generation set which a lot of ways often gets overlooked. So it's really great that you're but I can't tell us more about this side of things. Yeah, that's what I'm here for. So how do you then teach a computer to generate a file and read and write so for now, let's set our site the structure data part of natural language generation. \n",

      " Hi everyone. Welcome to this week's product School talk as you guys know, we teach product management coding and data courses that are six campuses. You guys can find more information on that in private school the.com today. We have a very special guest with us. He's done an AMA in our slack Community with us before and it was awesome and he has a lot to share with you today guys. So I'd like to welcome Kenneth Berger the very first product manager for slack. Welcome. Tennis are you doing Today, I'm doing great. Thanks for having me. Awesome. Well, we're really really excited to have you today. I know you have a presentation set up. So I'm going to give you a couple minutes to start screen sharing their and think so. All right. I'm on it. Awesome. So Kenneth is well, he's sharing that and getting that set up just so you guys know we're going to take questions after his presentation. So we'll have about 7 to 10 minutes for that and And you guys can just type of right next to the the YouTube link. So if Allah let you take it from here. Aw, thanks Sandra. So hi everybody, it's very nice of you to have me I had a ton of fun doing that Am A and B. So a few months back so excited to share a little bit more about what I learned at slack. It's definitely an interesting time for me.  All probably know in slacks been on pretty amazing Run for the past few years. And of course the question that everyone asks me is how do they do it? Right? What was what's the secret sauce? What was the thing that sort of made that growth? So explosive event, and I'm always a little disappointed. Well, yeah, there is no secret sauce that said here. What we did is slack and what the culture was right there. So what we get is other companies that I work for. The really were a few things that I hover notable and different and worth sharing. So especially in the wake of leaving. I wanted to make sure that I shared that stuff.  I want to jump in a little bit of an introduction. So these days I'm an executive coach. So I took my passion for helping people grow and the coaching world started doing that for the past couple of years. I work with CEO ctOS early and mid-stage companies as well as product managers for that. I was in probably manager for temples yours and slack Joby for a long time and I was a Founder as well. So I kind of see the whole life cycle of a product from foundings. oath to the church  I wanted to chat in folks about is this idea that I call Peaks and valleys? And this is really inspired by the questions that I start getting and once I started working for slag because you know, he would say the most amazing things I was so it was so gratifying to see o swag is so well designed so polished so wonderful, because from my perspective I was the BF right? My job was see all those wrong product by all the things that were not there at all or that were had serious room for improvement or Whatever it was and so I started to think about how do I rationalize these two things? All the problems are the areas of improvement. I see in a product and have I rationalized that with all this positive feedback. And what I realized was that really slack head Peaks and valleys and what I mean by that is that it had areas the product sure that we're missing right pieces of the vision that we had gotten to yet other than word especially polish, but it also Also had peace and those Peaks were places where we live above and beyond where we really sort of gave a little bit extra and that's that's what people remember it, right? They weren't noticing all that other stuff. That wasn't quite all extra wasn't quite there. They are remembering the things where we went a little bit above and beyond to make the product better to sort of show you really care and it's powerful idea.  what I mean by that is, you know, it's a lot of people are really using this idea of the MVP right the minimum viable product of the problem with building a minimum is that you're going above and beyond anywhere or if you're doing an absolute minimum and every area product and if you're only doing the demo How are people going to remember right? What's going to stand out in their mind straight a year from now or even next week right when you're trying to remember? Oh, yeah, what was that product I tried. And I actually use this Photograph here to illustrate that because I drew this for my photo library in photos. I'm taking on vacation, but I'm clearly I cared about it enough to take a picture and save it but I can't remember now. We're this is what country it is. Even what your the trip was on. I don't remember whether I was car like train I mean, so it's pretty right that was pretty enough to take the picture and serving its purpose in some sense, but The memorability is much lacking right now build a flat product which would take the picture that's good, but not particularly notable. Anyway, you're not necessarily doing it not you're not doing what the product is. \n",

      " And we were in saved for 2014 planning now. I'm sure none of you have ever seen a chart like this, especially since it's been in every presentation that I've gone to you today. But basically what happened was this what are this is what our sales growth numbers look like for 2014 and the conversation started. How are we gonna get there? So what we decided was that our client base was actually our biggest opportunity as well as our biggest challenge. So like many of you I'm sure what happened with Bentley as we go and we sellable one small piece of information. So you take a company like Pepsi and we're working with Pepsi or not working with Gatorade and we're not working with Mountain Dew Amazon and all of the different subsidiaries or different business. So we decided at the beginning of 2014 was that we're going to try something. We were going to rewrite the rules between sales and customer success. And this is where this gets a little bit controversial and for everyone in this room will have their own opinions on it. Basically what we decided to do with that customer success. We're going to own all upsells how we defined an upsell actually was anytime sales close an account under a parent company customer success with own that entire parent company relationship. So if we close the Pepsi it was now customer success job to go sell bitly to Gatorade and that we do and the same thing and when you talk about some of the biggest parent companies in the world, you take NBC Universal and things like that those to be like a massive opportunities that customer success was not only that relationship instead of sales.  This basically to talk a little bit about the strategy when we when we put it in the place that they him 2014 and taking this opportunity away from sales and putting it. We took the sales reps. We already had and we decided we're going to give them sales training. So we put them through sort of very quick sales 101 training and then we hired all new hires that cop came coming in or going to have some sort of sailed experience or upselling experience.  Here are counts based on growth potential. So we might look at a high-growth startup as just as valuable as a GE. We said very aggressive meeting quotas. So what we found out very quickly was and this is it comes in motion talk to anybody in this room. But the more meeting have especially in person meeting the higher the upsell value the way more likely you're going and he built the comp plan. So, of course if you're going to have customer success manager is managing upsells or to come them a little bit more like salespeople. So what we did was we took everyone's bonus structure and instead of making that based on, you know, we Cut the piece that was going to based on renewals and Fern and business effective. So they had that piece and then they also had a commission fees so they could essentially earn as much money as they possibly could with that outsell. So portable. This was a quote actually promoting my reps about three months in she came back and said I guess you were right about the email and call volume relating directly to upsell to you. So basically what we did was we putting in these meeting quotas. He said like the more you talk to your customers the more you are going to sell. I promise you. The better relationship you have the more money that's going to come in. They're going to want these people want to spend money with people a like if you will they talk to you all the time. Not just people who are helping them in a crisis. So I'm going to go ahead and jump the gun here and go a little bit to our results and then I'm gonna go back to why we can get work. So within one year of moving all the upselling and focusing on upsell within our group we decrease turn by 25% Upsell increase by two hundred and sixty-seven percent and one of the things people always ask me with this is you guys have more resources. We accurate answer is actually probably not because we have a lot more sales people that we have Christmas. That's right. So we actually probably decrease the amount of people who are working on these deals and up someone up by 267. \n",

      " We're going to talk about today is what is machine learning? Well, this is the world and world. We got humans and we have computers and one of the main differences between humans and computers is a humans learn from past experience. Whereas computers need to be told what to do they to be program. So they follow instructions. Now the question is can we get computers to learn from experience to and the answer is yes, we can and that's precisely what machine learning is. Of course for computers past experiences have a name of data. So in the next few minutes, I'm going to show you a few examples in which we can teach the computer how to learn from previous data and most importantly I'm going to show you that these algorithms are actually pretty easy and the Machine learning is really nothing to fear. \n",

      " Hello, my name is Joe more product manager. I work for pivotal Labs wearing agile web development holding company in San Francisco, New York bouldering and Singapore. This presentation assumes that you're at least somewhat familiar with agile software development, which is an iterative and incremental start development process that focuses on self-organizing cross-functional teams.  Familiar with that software development. There's a crossroad of books and internet sites that you can peruse at your leisure. The southern keeps to being a great agile product manager our vision ownership Independence decisiveness availability verification and flexibility, but a little bit more about me and why qualified I feel to be talking about this. I've been doing agile software development for over 11 years and have been a part of dozens of agile projects. everything from one person startups in Silicon Valley to large bureaucratic organizations at which some of which were internet companies others more traditional companies such as insurance companies. So I'm kind of seeing the gamut of agile projects and I've always been an engineer. So why me, I'm in the trenches software developer and Coach. I taking this opportunity because I really want to speak sort of from the horse's mouth.  Managers about how they can better serve their engineering team and how their engineering team can better serve them. I think a lot of people who give seminars and and time presentations such as I sort of giving it to their peers. I think it's important for people who have more might be more quote unquote business side of the organization to hear directly from those technical side of the organization, but how How they can work together better.  Give practical pragmatic day-to-day advice how to work with your agile Engineers. Yes. It's about helping you. But also it's about me being selfish. I like to code and coach and time coding and coaching at least 80% of the time than not as happy as I could be might not be as effective.  Case let's go through them Vision over documents as Engineers. We need an enthusiastic figurehead for the project person that really encapsulates embodies. The reason that we're developing this product. What we don't need is a big document that we have to reference all the time or that you have to reference all the time. We're smart people we read but what we do often lack that we can't get out of a document is product Vision sort of that the themes principles and guidelines for why we're even directly creating this product. We're looking to you to be the physical embodiment of this project. If you have great vision for the project, you can also have great ownership over it. We want this to be your baby. Not just one more thing for you to manage one more thing on your checklist. We are looking for a single point of contact and we don't want to have to run all of it organization trying to figure out get a question answered or something like that. We're looking for you to meet that figurehead and also that person who is ultimately responsible for getting the product delivered. We want know you have skin in the game Independence over Bianca. See this is about your empowerment make decisions and change directions versus Going to go through all the sort of a lengthy Change Control process or get a ton of sign off. If because we are iterating and you are seeing updates to the software ideally daily and hopefully customers are seeing it too. We want to know that you don't have to always go and ask the knowledgeable person when we answer to a question and we also because telephone communication we also want  We also want to know that if we have new knowledge new information that you have the independence to change course and course, correct without going through a lot of change management protocol. \n",

      " Enter and product hands and upgrade. I mean a lot of people who really excited about, you know, kind of starting their career as a product manager for when I talk to them. It turns out they have absolutely no idea. What if we mw a lot of people think that a poor manager system as a project manager, you know, some people think that product managers is just like a general manager at think that she has nothing to do with the College funding once and for all I really want to make players what the health of the product managers so you must have heard a lot of people say that a p.m. Is like a mini CEO of his or her products. So what does that actually mean? What what do you mean by saying that someone is the mini see you must have also seen that classic Venn diagram that RPM sits in the middle of business tag and user experience again, you know, that's more. Jargon unless you kind of understand what that so p.m. In my opinion that is required to ship a quality product sitting right in Broad terms. It can be broken down into Is there a market research business strategy and business modeling finding a great user experience by a product getting the product built from a technical point of view and then finally taking the product to market. The first thing that a p.m. Does is understanding the user and understanding the market right as a p.m. You're building a great product for your users. You're trying to solve problems or use it right? So understanding the user is out for parts of what a BMW. How does it to be em do it? Well, there are multiple ways, you know, people do surveys people do interviews people to sit with the users and see how they're using the product people just look at data to see how users are using the product. There are multiple ways of how you actually go and in-depth understand your users, but that's really a really large part of your role is here. the second thing that the PM does is build a solid understanding of the market and  In a lot of scenarios to understand why user should use your product and not a competitor's product. You need to understand the market in and out and what YouTube editor offers as state abbreviations, especially be scenario the competitor could mean a big difference between winning the sale or losing the next Simone thing that IBM does in her role is build a great strategy by product and tie it back to the bottom of it. Remember that you're trying to build a great product for users. But your item id gold for your company is also increase the profits on the revenue or the engagement whatever the key metrics are for your company. So it's very important that the PM invest time in understanding for company's business model and making sure that the strategy she's building for her product is in line with that business models for now comes the really exciting thing. The first thing that a p.m. Spends a lot of time doing is actually defining the experience for our I love you. Once you've defined your problem by understanding users understanding your Market thinking about the business model Etc. The next step is the actually cycle step which is now figuring out a solution for that problem typically is the steps involved in this solution or product design phase our first writing a strategy or a vision for your product. Like what do you want to achieve with this product? The Second Step then is figuring out a user flow for how you want to solve the problem. Depending on the size of the company all the type of the company working at you have a team of designers to help you with that. What this process involves is first building a wireframe. Think about wireframe as like a blueprint of a building that an architecture has its to help you visualize how the user for will work for your project. Once you kind of nailed on your right brain. The next step is building a prototype which in layman's term is like a working model of your products.  When data prototype back to users have them play around with it and then give you feedback here. The reviews is take the feed bags and kind of to the process again, unless you till you feel that you've kind of hit the nail on the head and I'm ready to move on to the next stage of actually participate. So now comes the build phase which is the grunt work with. \n",

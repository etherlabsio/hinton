The one thing we need to be careful of which I noticed it's not hasn't it occurred because we don't test it with that lower frequency, but the max does a reservation limit that you can set for Lambda functions. Basically you can say this is the maximum of concurrent reservations that execution this Lambda function type that is allowed. So right now the account level it is set mm meaning you cannot execute more than 1,000 concurrent Lambda functions at a single point in time. So we need to edit operate a place to raise the unreserved limit meaning by all by default. All of them can rise up to that level or we have to curb the execution concurrency for each Lambda function.Based on some experimentation and I would say let's increase it and get some metrics because we do get metrics how many times within books how frequent breaks and work and based on that? They can fine-tune the Lambda execution limit between okay now,. \",\n",

So at some point we can show like a full screen view for the timeline at the top screen, right? So then they can see the we can go back and forth, but it's not urgent thing.Okay, okay.All right, so that is on the full transcripts. And then now you know on the iOS deep Michelle, maybe you can start looking at showing the full transcription iOS also know that we have the implementation.So few things one is on the on the front end not a not a high priority. But something to check again is on the web and the web in particular to see if we can look at reducing the size of the lower right? Sometimes it takes a long time to load. So there are few things more pointed out something related to cash in policy and our CD MSX and also. Because we're gonna start to support more and more service providers. Just think through how we can do it on the client side instead of having to load all of them selectively always selective laser away to selectively low like maybe go make a query on the service provider and then you know that whatever I don't know.\",\n",

So for not there is a development level problem here because there's no prior isn't constantly learning. There is no cash. There's no local cache is your first time logging in once you receive the driven immediately try to make a call and in the call Flow you receive support not 3 that means either we introduce a new hinge point that Hoops who Scopes to which they don't have access to that means it's like a work flow problem during development cycle. We didn't test it. So that's why the gays for not 3, so that's they can solve it in the development learning itself. Thanks for not one. Basically unauthorized you are trying to access you person signed in but when you enter into slacks authorized ski accident center-right workspace because in the browser tab, he could have been logged into multiple slack workspaces before so we just signed into the lock twist. So we need to return a phone or rights over it does it for me?.  So at this point you're saying like, you know, you're trying to sign in right? We are giving back the token. So you forcibly not giving token. We will give back multi the token for whatever an authorized in the words flow. They might be already signed into more than one wall space in slack has been work Spurs wrong pocket, but during that process they won't say. \",\n",

       "    'originalText': \"Built in that we are actually visible from the back and we have seen that the top I know but when they make a call we'll give another is because we're trying to access the meeting through different workspace, but the token then approved for whole different workspaces the when they click on a meeting but selected around with specific during science process selected along workspace and click on author is which is very much possible with slack. It's in that case. We'll give 4:03 right because I'm not forgetting therefore that is 4 0 3 U disposability. So there is forbidden and irregardless we should just put that saying that you don't have sufficient privileges to watch this meeting. So what we are doing in Bev is so let's say we have two workspaces you loved in different workspace. So we check the workspace ID and caching is bit the workspace ID like a Leo that's exhausting work spaces. Yeah, we'll come that. We will conduct refreshed.Just delete this exactly but he selected a different workspace Trace from slack and goes back will again see that it's not there and we'll just show sign in. You know, we will not redirect to that on that URL which he was trying to get you to assume the works with did you receive for how do you know which works is it is four stoker. We will get workspace from the token. So that means you just need to show that you do not you need taken the sign in page, but we need to give them some information because they'll think they log right? Right. So at this point because you know that there is no Creator stick token or one more thing. What we are doing is when we know this redirect is from like we detect when they enter the URL for certain workspace try to exist. They're not looking they are taking to sign in page. We put a team ID. So even if they're. \",\n",

Okay, you should not use that for caching anywhere. Basically.

I have been playing around with the bot mean with the cost allocation and trying to see how well I can use it in a bunch of different cases and it's only as no only when you as a user you try to use it to try to figure, you know, you you know works or not. There have been a few issues that I've noticed. just the first issue is that Of course on the playback when the Parson resume happens the playback is still very jittery the you know, I've highlighted this a couple of times in the last week. This is something that I think we need to fix at least before we go and tell folks that we need to you know that we can use pause and resume. One of the things that we also have to do is to try and see if we can make the pasta Zoom more easy to access on the lower controls instead of being hidden in settings again most of the times I think for the this this is something that we it's not our ship blocker, but at least blocker but it's something that we should probably try and add soon thereafter. \",\n",

We don't see this on iOS by the way because I know iOS we actually hide the fact that the recording client is there so on the iOS client, it actually shows up nicely but on the web on the desktop app most of the time you're seeing The Ether recording client when you're recording a cast, so I don't know if this is something that's fixable but Something that we do definitely need to take care of. Okay, the third thing that I noticed when doing this was it takes a while for the for ether to join when you start the call and often I found myself starting the cost as soon as you join we may want to consider showing some kind of a we know that the recorder client has not yet joined as we keep falling I think on the client so we may want to either you know, show some kind of a warning that you know, that ether is getting ready for the cost and you know show that the uterus ethercast is ready only when the recording client join the something \",\n",

I don't know if people really understand that use case have having to create a channel. This is the other challenge that we need to work through maybe not it's not again. I don't think it's a release blocker because we we are encouraging folks to leave video messages for channels and not for DM's but it is something that we may want to highlight how we do this, right? Of course, you don't see that in the drop-down. As well because you see only the channels where ether has been invited but it is something that's like a to come up as well as an issue. Last but not the least and this is not you know, this may be addressed with the draft mode. But many times during cost at least you want to record the cost fully view the draft and then publish. So I'm not sure exactly how we handle that. Maybe that is a there is a way by which we can down the road introduced a way by which we record the draft and not necessarily a torch associate record the cost and not necessarily associated with the channel, but maybe once the cost is ready, you know, it goes into draft mode. \",\n",

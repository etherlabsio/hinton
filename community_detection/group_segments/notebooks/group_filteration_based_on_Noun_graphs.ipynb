      "What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview.\n",
      "This is a chance for them to call out and explain any certain skills or experience or things that might make uncertainty and high on you and so asking this question shows that you understand you are not a perfect candidate but then you do wanna to know what you can done better by the same and token if they do share something with you you now have an opportunity to say oh but I did not share this experience or maybe I need to tell you about this feels that I ask it is a chance for me to but become that objection maybe be realizing that you can give them everything they needed to to hear space.\n",
      "That is a really important question ask and that last question is what are the next steps in the process and that is you want to understand where you stand and what has to happen next beauty get hired you do not ever wanna leave a job wondering when you will get a phone call and they will follow up when they will make their decision.\n",
      "So ask this question is gonna help you get that information they are likely gonna tell you some things like while everything more people interview they will hear by this date you need to come back in for another interview, but at least you will have that information you will not be staring at the fathers or staring at your email has wondering whether or not you got the job you have the great thing about that is that if they give you a data that and it comes and goes you now have a valid reasons follow up with them and say when we spoke to the interview you mentioned and this will be the next steps that base come and gone is there anything else I can refer that my candidacy say so this is a really important question for you to ask for your own piece of mind at the same time it is going give you a sense of how structure this company is really how well got out their own hiring offices so that you can get a clear sense of whether or not they are the kind of company you wanna work there you how then the four C is connect culture challenges and clothes and with two questions of teams creates a super smart questions you should be asking hiring managers in your next job interview.\n",

      "So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we are getting the information we need and that is what I am gonna show you next.\n",
      "So we are starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side.\n",
      "So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer.\n",
      "This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company.\n",
      "Whilst you are gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you would really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company is stupid for you.\n",
      "The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role.\n",
      "Tell me about a hire recently that did not work out why did they fail them another role once again you want listen closely to the answer because we want to see if the traits are characteristics of that person who failed sound like yourself you do not think you can be successful there at the person it sounds like they really could not have a one in their job and you are gonna know that this is the right place for you and the thirteenth is challenge units and specifically the challenges of the company is going to get facing in the coming year.\n",
      "So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it.\n",
      "So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you are really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I am having a positive impact on this challenge.\n",
      "Note you wanna leave very clear and what the next step are so once we know the four C is it gets really easy to create questions.\n",
      "So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not.\n",
      "It is a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company.\n",
      "This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully.\n",
      "The right place for you and the second place you wanna ask is the polar opposite.\n",
      "So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great.\n",
      "I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that is something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they are recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this.\n",
      "Once again you are taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I am supposed to do that you are sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that is a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there is no real way to measure we will not have any idea whether or not you are making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you are gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company cannot measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably do not want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you are talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that is how to properly close up this conversation.\n",
      "So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they are like as a worker.\n",
      "If you are not asking questions if you want doing your do generation and if you mart having enough value in yourself.\n",
      "It ask clarifying mind questions to make sure that this business is the right place for you remember we always tell you you are a working daily that you are business of want selling your services to an employer and you wanna make sure that it is a good partnership so to do that you have got ask questions to make sure that this is the right place for you.\n",
      "So before break down the eight questions been to tell you that they fall into four categories that we call them the four C is now by cutting up on these four C is you are gonna make sure that you are asking all of us is necessary to make a great decision about this employer and those four C is are connect and to culture validate and closely even by out knows that guys hiring that person he will be working with one action questions to help you bond in the interview as far as culture does you wanna make sure this is the right corporate culture for you does this company believe and have values and go about business in the way that you respect trust that you.\n",

      "What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview.\n",
      "This is a chance for them to call out and explain any certain skills or experience or things that might make uncertainty and high on you and so asking this question shows that you understand you are not a perfect candidate but then you do wanna to know what you can done better by the same and token if they do share something with you you now have an opportunity to say oh but I did not share this experience or maybe I need to tell you about this feels that I ask it is a chance for me to but become that objection maybe be realizing that you can give them everything they needed to to hear space.\n",
      "That is a really important question ask and that last question is what are the next steps in the process and that is you want to understand where you stand and what has to happen next beauty get hired you do not ever wanna leave a job wondering when you will get a phone call and they will follow up when they will make their decision.\n",
      "So ask this question is gonna help you get that information they are likely gonna tell you some things like while everything more people interview they will hear by this date you need to come back in for another interview, but at least you will have that information you will not be staring at the fathers or staring at your email has wondering whether or not you got the job you have the great thing about that is that if they give you a data that and it comes and goes you now have a valid reasons follow up with them and say when we spoke to the interview you mentioned and this will be the next steps that base come and gone is there anything else I can refer that my candidacy say so this is a really important question for you to ask for your own piece of mind at the same time it is going give you a sense of how structure this company is really how well got out their own hiring offices so that you can get a clear sense of whether or not they are the kind of company you wanna work there you how then the four C is connect culture challenges and clothes and with two questions of teams creates a super smart questions you should be asking hiring managers in your next job interview.\n",
      "Best, but forward with respect challenges you wanna know what is keeping them up at night so that you can make sure these these are the kinds of challenges that you actually Wanna work on and leverage your skills to be successful flag and then lastly close you want to end this interviews conversation on a high.\n",
      "So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we are getting the information we need and that is what I am gonna show you next.\n",
      "So we are starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side.\n",
      "So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer.\n",
      "This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company.\n",
      "Whilst you are gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you would really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company is stupid for you.\n",
      "The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role.\n",
      "Tell me about a hire recently that did not work out why did they fail them another role once again you want listen closely to the answer because we want to see if the traits are characteristics of that person who failed sound like yourself you do not think you can be successful there at the person it sounds like they really could not have a one in their job and you are gonna know that this is the right place for you and the thirteenth is challenge units and specifically the challenges of the company is going to get facing in the coming year.\n",
      "So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it.\n",
      "So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you are really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I am having a positive impact on this challenge.\n",
      "Note you wanna leave very clear and what the next step are so once we know the four C is it gets really easy to create questions.\n",
      "So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not.\n",
      "It is a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company.\n",
      "This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully.\n",
      "The right place for you and the second place you wanna ask is the polar opposite.\n",
      "So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great.\n",
      "I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that is something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they are recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this.\n",
      "Once again you are taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I am supposed to do that you are sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that is a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there is no real way to measure we will not have any idea whether or not you are making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you are gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company cannot measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably do not want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you are talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that is how to properly close up this conversation.\n",
      "So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they are like as a worker.\n",
      "If you are not asking questions if you want doing your do generation and if you mart having enough value in yourself.\n",
      "It ask clarifying mind questions to make sure that this business is the right place for you remember we always tell you you are a working daily that you are business of want selling your services to an employer and you wanna make sure that it is a good partnership so to do that you have got ask questions to make sure that this is the right place for you.\n",
      "So before break down the eight questions been to tell you that they fall into four categories that we call them the four C is now by cutting up on these four C is you are gonna make sure that you are asking all of us is necessary to make a great decision about this employer and those four C is are connect and to culture validate and closely even by out knows that guys hiring that person he will be working with one action questions to help you bond in the interview as far as culture does you wanna make sure this is the right corporate culture for you does this company believe and have values and go about business in the way that you respect trust that you.\n",
      "So that mind let us take a look at the eight questions you should be asking me your next category.\n",
      "There is is showing that that you understand you are a business of one your service provider and that what you are going to do is help them solve a about and alleviate your team.\n",
      "Alright so what do you do when you are in an interview and we get to that end where the hiring manager looks at you and said, give any questions for me all of course you do in fact it is very important you ask questions I wanna tell you the recently and a employer right now reached out to be frustrated and said I hate when I asked that question and the person says otherwise that he is been really nice.\n",
      "It is like kicking the tires are looking under the eyes make sure that you are making a good investment.\n",
      "I think I am okay that person told me does mac get hired and the reason for that is that they have real confirmed.\n",

Alright so what do you do when you're in an interview and we get to that end where the hiring manager looks at you and said, give any questions for me all of course you do in fact it is very important you ask questions I wanna tell you the recently and a employer right now reached out to be frustrated and said I hate when I asked that question and the person says otherwise that he's been really nice. I think I'm okay that person told me does mac get hired and the reason for that is that they have real confirmed. If you aren't asking questions if you want doing your do generation and if you mart having enough value in yourself. It ask clarifying mind questions to make sure that this business is the right place for you remember we always tell you you're a working daily that you are business of want selling your services to an employer and you wanna make sure that it's a good partnership so to do that you've got ask questions to make sure that this is the right place for you. It's like kicking the tires are looking under the eyes make sure that you're making a good investment. So that mind let's take a look at the eight questions you should be asking me your next category. So before break down the eight questions been to tell you that they fall into four categories that we call them the four C's now by cutting up on these four C's you're gonna make sure that you're asking all of us is necessary to make a great decision about this employer and those four C's are connect and to culture validate and closely even by out knows that guys hiring that person he'll be working with one action questions to help you bond in the interview as far as culture does you wanna make sure this is the right corporate culture for you does this company believe and have values and go about business in the way that you respect trust that you.\"], '2019-12-24T09:58:35Z', 'a366bdbcba2f4b09ba6cad0c614af9ca', '9d6a3e61-6424-400e-b4b0-1206bcaa134d'], [[\"Best, but forward with respect challenges you wanna know what's keeping them up at night so that you can make sure these these are the kinds of challenges that you actually Wanna work on and leverage your skills to be successful flag and then lastly close you want to end this interviews conversation on a high. Note you wanna leave very clear and what the next step are so once we know the four C's it gets really easy to create questions. So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we're getting the information we need and that's what I'm gonna show you next. So we're starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side. This is a great place for that to work. So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they're like as a worker. The second question is what left knows about working here. So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer. This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company. Whilst you're gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you'd really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company's stupid for you. So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not. It's a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company. The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role. This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully. I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that's something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they're recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this.\"], '2019-12-24T10:00:35Z', 'a366bdbcba2f4b09ba6cad0c614af9ca', '3412bc46-5798-40e7-857d-4535d497d0e9'], [[\"The right place for you and the second place you wanna ask is the polar opposite. Tell me about a hire recently that didn't work out why did they fail them another role once again you want listen closely to the answer because we want to see if the traits are characteristics of that person who failed sound like yourself you don't think you can be successful there at the person it sounds like they really couldn't have a one in their job and you're gonna know that this is the right place for you and the thirteenth is challenge units and specifically the challenges of the company is going to get facing in the coming year. So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it. What you're doing. There's is showing that that you understand you're a business of one your service provider and that what you're going to do is help them solve a about and alleviate your team. So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you're really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I'm having a positive impact on this challenge. Once again you're taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I'm supposed to do that you're sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that's a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there's no real way to measure we won't have any idea whether or not you're making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you're gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company can't measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably don't want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you're talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that's how to properly close up this conversation. So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great.\"], '2019-12-24T10:02:35Z', 'a366bdbcba2f4b09ba6cad0c614af9ca', '724855cf-8b6a-4994-b762-be106066dda5'], [[\"But I tell you it really works is if there were some skills or experience which I had that would make me a benefit fit for this job. What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview. This is a chance for them to call out and explain any certain skills or experience or things that might make uncertainty and high on you and so asking this question shows that you understand you're not a perfect candidate but then you do wanna to know what you can done better by the same and token if they do share something with you you now have an opportunity to say oh but I didn't share this experience or maybe I need to tell you about this feels that I ask it's a chance for me to but become that objection maybe be realizing that you can give them everything they needed to to hear space. That's a really important question ask and that last question is what are the next steps in the process and that's you want to understand where you stand and what has to happen next beauty get hired you don't ever wanna leave a job wondering when you'll get a phone call and they'll follow up when they'll make their decision. So ask this question is gonna help you get that information they're likely gonna tell you some things like while everything more people interview they'll hear by this date you need to come back in for another interview, but at least you'll have that information you won't be staring at the fathers or staring at your email has wondering whether or not you got the job you have the great thing about that is that if they give you a data that and it comes and goes you now have a valid reasons follow up with them and say when we spoke to the interview you mentioned and this will be the next steps that base come and gone is there anything else I can refer that my candidacy say so this is a really important question for you to ask for your own piece of mind at the same time it's going give you a sense of how structure this company is really how well got out their own hiring offices so that you can get a clear sense of whether or not they're the kind of company you wanna work there you how then the four C's connect culture challenges and clothes and with two questions of teams creates a super smart questions you should be asking hiring managers in your next job interview.

Alright so what do you do when you're in an interview and we get to that end where the hiring manager looks at you and said, give any questions for me all of course you do in fact it is very important you ask questions I wanna tell you the recently and a employer right now reached out to be frustrated and said I hate when I asked that question and the person says otherwise that he's been really nice. I think I'm okay that person told me does mac get hired and the reason for that is that they have real confirmed. If you aren't asking questions if you want doing your do generation and if you mart having enough value in yourself. It ask clarifying mind questions to make sure that this business is the right place for you remember we always tell you you're a working daily that you are business of want selling your services to an employer and you wanna make sure that it's a good partnership so to do that you've got ask questions to make sure that this is the right place for you. It's like kicking the tires are looking under the eyes make sure that you're making a good investment. So that mind let's take a look at the eight questions you should be asking me your next category. So before break down the eight questions been to tell you that they fall into four categories that we call them the four C's now by cutting up on these four C's you're gonna make sure that you're asking all of us is necessary to make a great decision about this employer and those four C's are connect and to culture validate and closely even by out knows that guys hiring that person he'll be working with one action questions to help you bond in the interview as far as culture does you wanna make sure this is the right corporate culture for you does this company believe and have values and go about business in the way that you respect trust that you. Best, but forward with respect challenges you wanna know what's keeping them up at night so that you can make sure these these are the kinds of challenges that you actually Wanna work on and leverage your skills to be successful flag and then lastly close you want to end this interviews conversation on a high. Note you wanna leave very clear and what the next step are so once we know the four C's it gets really easy to create questions. So we can ask them the interviews to make sure that we're getting the information we need and that's what I'm gonna show you next. So we're starting with connect and the first question you should always ask in an interview is how did you come to work here this is an opportunity for you to bond with this as a well by learning how they got hired by the company why through the into the company what made this side. This is a great place for that to work. So gonna give you a lot of insights to their own decisions and what they're like as a worker. The second question is what left knows about working here. So important that you ask a positive question that lets been talk about open seems a they love about the employer. This is gonna be a great chance for you to Bond and share a love for the things that are great about working at this company. Whilst you're gonna be able to validate whether or not you sound like things that you'd really care about remember these questions are designed for you it insight into whether or not just company's stupid for you. So while very positive questions is also giving you a chance to evaluate whether or not. It's a fit the second is cultures specifically cold culture and the two questions are going to ask care are around individuals that have been hired at the company. The first question is tell me about the most successful hire use may why is that person been very successful in their role. This is gonna to help you understand who has being recognised with the organization as a high performer you wanna listen carefully. I mean at an example, if they tell you a person you gave in it works eighty hours a week and took everything that they had to do and worked with no budget and real able to knock it out of the time does that sound like a place you wanna work is that's something like of Facebook work like balance it has their dust in row no so if they're recognizing that as a bit hire did you know this. The right place for you and the second place you wanna ask is the polar opposite. Tell me about a hire recently that didn't work out why did they fail them another role once again you want listen closely to the answer because we want to see if the traits are characteristics of that person who failed sound like yourself you don't think you can be successful there at the person it sounds like they really couldn't have a one in their job and you're gonna know that this is the right place for you and the thirteenth is challenge units and specifically the challenges of the company is going to get facing in the coming year. So first question you want ask is tell me now the biggest challenge you think the company will experience this year at how will this job helps and overcome it. What you're doing. There's is showing that that you understand you're a business of one your service provider and that what you're going to do is help them solve a about and alleviate your team. So by asking them with that pain or that problem is and how you can help solve that you're really sending a message to then you understand your role if you get hired the second question you wanna to the very challenges is around of format how do I measure my own performance to ensure that I'm having a positive impact on this challenge. Once again you're taking full ownership of your work of your efforts and by telling them that I understand that I'm supposed to do that you're sending a clear message to them you really will be accountable for your actions and that's a great selling speaker at the same time though if they come back you and say well there's no real way to measure we won't have any idea whether or not you're making an impact that would be a huge red flag to you because you're gonna wanna be able to do that in order to get a promotion or gonna raise what kind of company can't measure impact us a sign of a company that you probably don't want work for so you can see there why these questions are really warn not only do they setting up well with the employer by that you know what you're talking about also is gonna use some key insight into whether or not you wanna work that now the fourth and final is about close and that's how to properly close up this conversation. So the question that you wanna to ask and this you can a little great. But I tell you it really works is if there were some skills or experience which I had that would make me a benefit fit for this job. What would may be this is your polite where asking if they feel you have any shortcomings for if there is something sufficient about what you presented to them stage during the interview. This is a chance for them to call out and explain any certain skills or experience or things that might make uncertainty and high on you and so asking this question shows that you understand you're not a perfect candidate but then you do wanna to know what you can done better by the same and token if they do share something with you you now have an opportunity to say oh but I didn't share this experience or maybe I need to tell you about this feels that I ask it's a chance for me to but become that objection maybe be realizing that you can give them everything they needed to to hear space. That's a really important question ask and that last question is what are the next steps in the process and that's you want to understand where you stand and what has to happen next beauty get hired you don't ever wanna leave a job wondering when you'll get a phone call and they'll follow up when they'll make their decision. So ask this question is gonna help you get that information they're likely gonna tell you some things like while everything more people interview they'll hear by this date you need to come back in for another interview, but at least you'll have that information you won't be staring at the fathers or staring at your email has wondering whether or not you got the job you have the great thing about that is that if they give you a data that and it comes and goes you now have a valid reasons follow up with them and say when we spoke to the interview you mentioned and this will be the next steps that base come and gone is there anything else I can refer that my candidacy say so this is a really important question for you to ask for your own piece of mind at the same time it's going give you a sense of how structure this company is really how well got out their own hiring offices so that you can get a clear sense of whether or not they're the kind of company you wanna work there you how then the four C's connect culture challenges and clothes and with two questions of teams creates a super smart questions you should be asking hiring managers in your next job interview. Okay. So now that you have. I can hear I want hear from you if there one particular question you've asked in an interview that got a great resolved or maybe uses a question you apps that didnt get a good result make sure you share it with me below you want your you okay so questions not in feedback regarding this video we just to make sure you post it below we answer each everyone and I also hope that you will share and like this content because you know there's a lot of people out there that need help care questions, you'll be doing that in a favor and I'll make you as good as well lastly don't forget to subscribe each every week we're bringing to fresh new career content that help you get ahead and most of importantly I can't wait to see you in the next video so with in mind remember this if you wanna win you've got work it daily. \n",

      "Story of pre reinforcement learning all the way back to AI tangible psychology and the and the heart it it also enough by a person animal robot would that when it investigate an environment with the code back cart to sparkles org sponsors are a great example of this just think of what our product less agent would have to deal with his own batch the one have to consider actions like it deserves returns and these actions change the state of the game or in other words. The current set the leading player things like that and every action is performed with a reward mind when a point in order to win game set and match our needs to follow a policy or set roles and strategies in order to maximize the final score. What if you were building on autonomous agent how would you actually model this we know that the agents actions will change the status environment. So model would need to see it what a he state and action is input and generate a maximum perspective rewards output a*sumption we gets you to the next day and may taken to account the total expected reward for every action from the current of the end state the way of us works will be different for every application and I'm probably not surprised to know that golden had agent is different for building an atari agent the searchers a line he's a series of Atari screenshots to build a confirmation barrel network with a couple of tweaks the output wasn't in a cla*s but instead it was a target that was have a actual award. Was actually dealing with regression on notification they also didn't use Polish players since unlike image recognition individual possessions of gateway objects like the player are all important and can't be reduced current that could have been used through as long as they ask what layer was tailored for aggression. He had input in each time step included at the action and the environment that's also a deep q network or themes for short the deep also uses the principles of projecting the maximum reward given escape action. He was actually patented by Google and has seen a lot of improvements like the experience free play and the tooling network architecture. Enforcement learning is just a fancy smart side way to see supervised learning supervised learning is all about making sense of the environment based on historical examples. And that isn't always the best way to do things imagine if you're trying to drag a car and heavy each pa*s based the web patterns you observed the week before when the roads were clear that's I'm this effective stride where are all looking in the year reinforcement. My learning on the other hand this all about rewards you get points for your actions like fame in your lane driving under the speed limit segment when you're supposed to things like that you can also lose points for dangerous actions like and speeding. So in fact need to take the back something above points possible given the current state of the traffic on the road value you reinforcement learning exercises seven action results in a change of state, which is something super were model doesn't focus on. Girl twenty Sixteen Amazon's cyber Jeff basis talked about how these companies great place to fail and how most companies are unwilling to suffer through the stream of scaled experiments. You can pick of this as a statement about rewards most organizations operate in the realm of conventional wisdom. What is about explaining what is known to achieve finite rewards odds. Some Spencer into the unknown and export territory with the prospect of outside rewards at all odds and many of these applications do fail a some of seed and end up changing the wallet with reinforcement learning and native exports trained off between expiration at location and choose the path to the maximum capacity born. Channels all about deep working so we focused this on as topic of building reinforcement net, but reinforcement learning off under the broader umbrella artificial intelligence. It involves topics like goal setting planning and perception and it can even form our bridge between AI and the engineering discipline. Automate learning simple of powers and get them the recent advances to has the potential become date before the field.

Require some kind of marketing or advertising then you wanna to think of how you touch this it gonna be in press very often today know a lot of advertising internet are you going to print brochures for almost any other kind of paid tab. You'll decide what you want to have how this relates to your budget and what you gonna afford now the most important thing about a marketing plan you should ever forget is to evaluate how effective these advertis***nts and marketing and ideas are and somehow either through surveys conducted with your customers or some sort of post event valuation determine whether or not any of this marketing actually produces his customers if they they don't produce customers then they're not effective and for the following year for your next year marketing plan. We probably want to eliminate them or change them some why so it's it will become more effective in the end you'll have an effective marketing plan mean I idea is just new running wisely. So of I mean you spend linkedin. In my last video we went through a process of getting a marketing budget that was also payment to your individual or business needs than the and the all encompa*sing what can get when you ask what should I asking i also promised the video that within testing the house allocate that okay so here it is last time we're all about taking something that was over and not you and incorporating it slightly. So great good this time we're doing a there's a bit of the opposite because if you start doing some research on the internet how you to kind of pay your mark touch it what you're going to find this you get really confused maybe quickly and probably start thinking that this some kind of dark option involved as so the case just the fact that there's million different businesses out there Google had different results from different marketing bunch allocation and budget and as such we've have ended up with millions of different results for how to allocate your budget what I want speak here was painters of those of you who have absolutely no idea where start with page parts but it and gives you an idea of what the average business doing how that give you something to build repository in the stage stuff. So first off. We need to distinguish between the different areas that you can spend your mind and those come down to online absolutely offline media. If that you can showcase that direct marketing that you can do and market research where your this try that puts into learning about how your markets is changing and changing your allocation to that now based. The internet research April checking down on board and then putting on my personal experience spread clients kicks and itself come up with these sort of figures where the average business spends around the option budget online they they send another the sense offline and the rest of their budget goes into twenty percent or events fifteen percent of direct marketing opportunities and five said let's go know research. Now I'm sure some of your shouting at this screen see graphic thinking. I absolutely no idea what I'm talking about and all that is is proof that your business stage individual and you're already work events change those from the average to yeah you might end know was something a little bit like this or something to be, but either weighing on hope this helps and given you a foundation that we to build and you leave me with your thoughts and comments in the so get in touch and let me know question I have that you think I'm not go twelve in forthcoming videos, obviously if we think anyone else could benefit from this information they share it with them.

      "Tech technical product management. If you're at beyond in our cloud data apps and this whiteboard session is all about giving kubernetes you five minutes and it's going to be a little bit of a challenge. So I'm gonna have the show a lot of detailed concepts and kubernetes, but I want give you a rough idea what is it and let us actually do and what is responsible for so there's a few different architectural components too, which I'm gonna talk about the first of which is the kubernetes cluster services and the fundamental from behind kubernetes is that we can enforce what's called desired state manager. Really what that means is that I'm going to feed the cluster services as specific configuration that will be up up to the cluster services to go out and run that configuration in my infrastructure right one of the main components that I do what to call out is this API that sits in front all these API service. So that is one able walk up the system. The second building block of the system is this thing called day worker and what is a worker? Well, the worker is really just a container host the one thing unique about a worker or the container host in a nineties environment. It does have this equivalent process that runs, which is responsible for communicating with yes, you guessed kubernetes cluster services and so this whole thing the cluster services. The workers themselves that's what makes up is oracle cost. So let's talk about use case. So in this case you what we wanna do is wanna feed this the configuration. So the desired snake service to speak exists here in a deployment yellow file. So here I'm just gonna call an application one dot. Inside this there could be a whole bunch of configuration information that I yelled got a bypa*s quite a bit of the parameter. I talk about two fundamental the first of which in this deployment file. A pod configuration pods is like the Smallest units of deployment and kubernetes in terms of the kubernetes object and what it means is that in a pod I can have running containers and you can have one or more. So in order to run that part. I need to specify some sort of container image. Maybe I want to have to container images and further demo line. There's other things like what people board and we're services right or what that, but another additional thing is that I'm gonna specify how many of these pods you could be running here. So maybe there's three more number that I can also list additional box of your flaws. So pod number two yeah, I basically have container image number three and then replicas as a configuration file equal to two. So what happens. I will take this deployment file and will be it to the API with up you'll be up to the cluster service figure out how to schedule the pods in the environment and make sure that I have the right number of pods. So I see this file up here let's work on pod one so I'm gonna have pod one replica one pod one replica two pod one replica three in addition I've also got pod. So here we are pod to replica one and in this case we have two replica here. So let's just do pod one replica to here and so you can see at any point in time the cluster services a responsibility to make sure that configuration is running across all of my computer code groups. \n",

      "I know like for and you're watching selling right now some so what's part of business is that think there a logical thing that on that and there's no better example, this to Gorilla a market where you try and make a lot of impact a very content, but we actually have one band the thing J timelines limits today we're gonna look at it open real world its listing nice or see and we'll show you the various not team to see what would best suit your business commerce club was born in nineteen thirty thirty at and he studied psychology, which gave to around world work after you learn the trade in London and then give back the United States upon further their each for you work on some of the most famous campaigns all times more man to these tiger and all of which are now for history, but this is great that human is his book to real marketing what one million copies that was translated to go over time. The core concept is not a pure small business available like the jungle really the technology sorry and you need to find a new or file and your best one and this product limits instead that in this experience that we to on the unexpected way it's never much larger inactive auxiliary build pods. Now it's also important to be very direct the image tearing being sales quickly before the book out giant companies is the messages all the things like interaction where this this to for the gorilla where them. It's a sales so all working in the innovative with original also need a crystal clear which pushes sales. So this question is how do you do this little more at the number of yeah person this is working put advertising the appointment or message highly we use. There's a great also a lot of inspiration people really notice things that play with buyer there.

Now go ahead, open up your favorite.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Start changing and try to look up for What is it?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That means we do not get it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The people who are already using the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But the people who do not understand the FBI, we need to target at people.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You need to make sure that they understand.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me give you a quick example, and I will give you two examples.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well move on to our animation, bored very quickly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"See how the Dbms Family evolved with time the following diagram shows the evolution of DBMs categories.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Focus again on a so now you understand that API is a requirement written by someone else and you can use that code in your application and then that is it now sometime in that application you have to use an API as well so then the menus of that called or that feature is not there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Okay so I you when the one is a I and from now onwards.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"She was never ever look on what is API guy rather you are looking on thing that is I can use that API that would be much more important.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So varies all how and maybe tell the I will try to make sure that you understand how a p is are paying used as well like you know they comments comment section down below that from this language.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You might want to initialize that feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Fine on that framework Microsoft is finished huge amount of time in researching on using microsoft framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"They started it right from Nineteen ninety six.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"dinner and these containers are the absolute heart off the Docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These containers wrap up your entire code on these are absolutely portable.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The portability is both absolute charm off the Docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now we can dig this container and bay where you are going to put this country that it is gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, the clasic example is, whenever you are learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not talking about the GHB Paschal package.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am talking about just the score, my as. Cuba.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is one of the most challenging thing.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody is running Windows, Mac and violence.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Theyre super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"He is the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you are running from the networking information that you are running.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something is in your code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is a client side application program.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And you do not have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker also act as a social networking.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The parent the machine learning is behind all while things like tagging objects and people inside of photos or clarity machine learning like it may help be immediately apparent that recommending the next video watch is it also power machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"These two pieces broadly the outline the two sides machine learning both of them be important using data is what we were refer to as train well same license is referred to as making predictions or inputs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now let us grow into those two side frequent for a little bit training refers to use to inform the creation and Python of a predictive model this predictive model can then be used to server position.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe four search engine may be producing moving Docker XnumberX logger inside of them features.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now we also know that there is one of the very important people who live to sign in peach.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So one of the code feature is an organ system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So it is already being done there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So what I am using there is I am using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now, although this enttled code is written by the Google, but I do not have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"How am I even provide new features?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now there is one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So there is one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"the example of the guy is very simple.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You do not feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let us say you want to fly from Jeff.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So how is that possible that you are looking from the third party Web site, but still you are getting a seat on the same plane?\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let us want over animation section and give you an example that you are already using off the idea.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now let us try to understand what is this A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"and we are gonna use a simple example that you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Some of you might have already beat.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So let me bring up my own website here.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So now let us get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"He used a kind of a feature known a sign up.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I thought, this sign of features pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You just registered in your name, email address, pasport and then I send you information even at your email and use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let us bring up Google that side.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Credit so in session and what is net framework.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was July like two thousand when bill gates up period in a B d C with stands of process develop conference in our line of data where be that we have uploaded it now and we call it microsoft dot net framework like Microsoft dot net easily was named as n G w U S, which stands for next generation windows service, but Microsoft is marketing team later around named it as startup.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is not This is your A.P.I.. Now, there is no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is the simplest thing in the world.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"is just a code written by someone else that I do not really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circmstances would have bean that what these people have written this code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And I can use that in my application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"For example, logging into this Google are logging.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put any satellite into the space.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything is and going on there.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the XnumberX eyes now, some of the FBI is are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Django will is a freak here that you can use.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if you are going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we will talk about the fire ways in some other movies on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is forget about all that thing in.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Is what I was just explaining that you have two different programming running languages, which required two different core managers libraries and sometimes.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So this is something which is really tedious to go with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now as you you happen to have this basic and installed in your computer system and you have a paradigm time manage and the total window and it goes on and on and on the more language.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"If you bio in your computer system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now would not it be great if you just happen to have only one set a run time funds set of library very and one single and deal with programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"I am just like you share anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"You can share your Docker image so that whenever somebody wants to start at a given specific checkpoint and start there and lost, but not the least Docker is also a complete That does not manage all of this for you know, as I promised in the start of the video, I have not shared some of the person expedience with the dog as well, So here we go.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Be sure Buck again with the video.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And in this video we are gonna talk about Docker.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"After watching this video, I promise you that the concept of the Docker will be absolutely clear to you.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And by the end of the video, I will also share with experience the person one where Docker was absolutely lifesaver for me.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So little daughter and talk about what is Dr Bennett were a product is being designed.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The first and the only gold we will be in that product is I want to solve a specific problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Or somehow I want to reduce the friction that users are currently pacing in that problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So in order to understand the talker first and foremost, we need to understand what is the problem statement that Docker is trying to resolve.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Are four major types of Dbms let us look into them in detail hierarchical.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMs employs the parent child relationship of storing data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMs is rarely used nowadays is structured like a tree with notes representing records and branches representing fields.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The windows registry used in windows is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with Nodes network dbMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMS supports many to many relationships.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This usually result complex database structures server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relation dBMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type of DBMs defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Unlike the network B M s our dBms does now support many to many relationships relational dBMs usually have pre defined data types that they can support.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is the most popular dBMs type in the market examples of relational database management systems include Oracle and microsoft SQL server object oriented relational dBMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This type support stories of new data types that data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that define what to do with the data host green SQL L is an example of object oriented relational dBMs.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Seen data and answer the clients and data gathered the model to be improved time and new predictive models deployed as you may have noticed the key component of this entire process is data everything hinges on data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Yeah guys can to Unbox the machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are certain issues which are probably almost every time.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Well, that problem is whenever you are designing a project, it was absolutely fine in your machine, the developer machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody is else computer.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your friends are maybe a manager.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Although here we are talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe your images are not being loaded properly.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Maybe the palace is a little bit different.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So the clasic problem is it works on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This further brings the clasic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that is why the problem is occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it is compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you are working on.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Come to this tutorial series on SQL and database, but before we learn about database.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is understand what is data in simple words dating could be facts related to an object in consideration for example, your name age height weight etcetera are some data related to you and pictures.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Query language SQL pronounced as SQL or sometimes as sequel is actually this standard language for dealing with relational databases SQL can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does not mean SQL cannot do things beyond on that in fact it helps in optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like oracle Ms SQL Sai etcetera use SQL SQL syntax is used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different and even proprietary SQL an example of an SQL statement selected star from members where age is greater than thirty DBMs stands for database management system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most widely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It uses SQL as the standard query language sQL is the standard language used to query a database the database approach has many advantages when it comes to storing data compared to the traditional flat file based systems.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Same work is not a new industry usually frameworks are not designed with the visa that from white of old for common functionality in industry.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There are so many frameworks around which are providing first from challenges support to build enterprise sections.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now what my microsoft simple test is just doing this similar thing what another framework does so a adopted framework is also consisting of life valleys and clases, which are designed to achieve a common code across various type of applications when in Microsoft challenge rates.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now if you want to understand a bit more about framework work.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Then have a look at these points here that a framework is a software layer which just sitting between your operating system and dot net compliant programming languages.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"So Microsoft framework is a software earlier layer which says the business studio view and operating system.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It is supports many two running languages as a framework is supposed to do are supposed to provide common functionality across different type of application.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Microsoft docment Framework in public and it evolved.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let me help you the why dot was fairly needed what purpose it is a strongly in industry if you know about C or programming languages or even then basic financial of these two from our languages C users has include S p I or downs to perform and Jeff and the scanning functionality.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Similarly C does is as soon type of programming running language with object to date framework edit and it uses dot these two languages are almost same they perform same type of functionality, but they have to just in type of some time environment they have two different set of libraries on together two different from two different management techniques and so on means if you have my specific type of application moving to owned it can using C or it can be told up using C plus plus, but at the given point of time you are dealing with or interacting with two different runtime environment and do this and code credentials.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Now what is a data database we already know what data is, but this data could be random a database is a systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"What is a database management system DBMs database management system or DBMs is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access a database manipulate data and help in the representation of data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It also helps control access to the database by various users.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Let is discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a dBMS to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data etcetera.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It needs to store manipulate and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisnts and a lot more.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of DBMS database management systems are not a new concept and as such has been first implemented in the nineteen sixties Charles docments integrated data store or d is said to be the first DbMs in history with time database technologies evolved a aligned while usage and unexpected functional of databases have been increased immensely types of DBMs M s.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"World it is filled with data a lot of data pictures music words spreadsheets videos and it does not look like it is going to slow down any anytime soon machine learning brings the promise of driving me all of that partners further famously once said any sufficiently that technology is in this individual from that I found not to be magic rather and technology and you can utilize and answer questions with your data.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"This is cloud aI makers my name did you label well and each episode we will be exploring the art science and tools from machine learning along the way we will see just how easy it is to create a meeting experiences and your valuable insights the value of machine learning is on just beginning to show itself.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"There is a lot of data in the world today generated not only by people but also by computers phones and other devices this will only continue to grow and the years call traditionally humans have alyzed data and adapted systems to the changes the patterns.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"However, that is the volume of data suggestion.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"The ability humans makes sense of it and manually write those rules we will turn and increase so automate automated like a third data and importantly the changes in data to adapt to a shifting landscape.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"We see machine learning all around the product view.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Perhaps the biggest example of all is Google search every time you use Google search you are using a system as machine learning system that core from understanding the text of your query to adjusting the results based on your first interests such as knowing which results to when searching for Java depending anyhow whether you are a copy expert or developer.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"Perhaps your both today machine learning immediate applications are already quite white ranging including recognition fraud detection and recommendation systems as well as texts each systems too being powerful capabilities can we apply to a wide range fields from and skin cancer detection to retail and of course in the form of self parking and self vehicles.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"It was not that long ago that want a company or product and machine learning in a offerings.\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\"He was considered novel now and my company is visiting to use machine learning and their products in some way it is rapidly becoming well an expect feature trust as we expect companies that have a website that works on your mobile device or perhaps I have a the day was come when it will be expected that our technology will be personalized

But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody's else computer. Maybe your friends are maybe a manager. This computer. In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place. Although here we're talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum. Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net. Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly. Maybe the palace is a little bit different. All glitchy and solve these cases. That is a cla*sic example. When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place. It doesn't work like that. So the cla*sic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the cla*sic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check. And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring.

      "everyone they share back again. Now, in this video, even talk about what is A.P.I. are also on this application. Programming Integration. Now, this is a very common Adam Bay you spent on. It is a problem in our society or a computer society. Begin zero f with people understand that some trick or not, we just wanted to be technically correct. So if you look up for the A.P.I. destination on any platform Wikipedia block, they are technically correct. That's one part, but they're not so much understandable. So in this video, we're going to make sure that you understand A.P.I. what is A.P.I.? And after watching this video, you never, ever watch any video on A.P.I. or block because you will be understanding each and every bit off idea. So let's get started. Let's talk about what is A.P.I.. Now go ahead, open up your favorite. Start changing and try to look up for What is it? Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here. A.P.I.. What is it? A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system. Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle. That means we don't get it. What disease Yet? The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I. will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point. Understand? Here's the problem. The people who are already using the A.P.I. I don't mean to understand. What is it? Yeah, because they know about it. But the people who don't understand the FBI, we need to target at people. You need to make sure that they understand. So let me give you a quick example, and I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation, bored very quickly. \n",

      "the example of the guy is very simple. Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping. I remember the example. This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.  \n",

      "Now we all know that this kind of code is there on the Google for bad idea purposes. Maybe four search engine may be producing moving Docker 84 logger inside of them features. Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.  \n",

      "Hey, no problem at all. I'll give you a A.P.I. key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I. key works. So yes, that is it. This isn't This is your A.P.I.. Now, there's no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area. It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging. The Facebook are the most common example of using the A.P.I. off Facebook and Google on. You want to see other things as well like, for example, if I want to just use our make a simple mobile app off better application under Tony Stark. I'm not gonna put any satellite into the space. And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  \n",

It is a problem in our society or a computer society. Begin zero f with people understand that some trick or not, we just wanted to be technically correct. So if you look up for the A.P.I. destination on any platform Wikipedia block, they are technically correct. That's one part, but they're not so much understandable. So in this video, we're going to make sure that you understand A.P.I. what is A.P.I.? And after watching this video, you never, ever watch any video on A.P.I. or block because you will be understanding each and every bit off idea. So let's get started. Let's talk about what is A.P.I.. Now go ahead, open up your favorite. Start changing and try to look up for What is it? Yeah, let me help you and try to read what is written on your very favorite Greek idiot here. A.P.I.. What is it? A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system. Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle. That means we don't get it. What disease Yet? The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I. will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point. Understand? Here's the problem. The people who are already using the A.P.I. I don't mean to understand. What is it? Yeah, because they know about it. But the people who don't understand the FBI, we need to target at people. You need to make sure that they understand. So let me give you a quick example, and I'll give you two examples. We'll move on to our animation, bored very quickly. \n",

      "the example of the guy is very simple. Now it is something which is helping you to have a seamless connective ity. You don't feel that you are getting connected with so much of the thing, but that idea is actually helping. I remember the example. This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important. Nothing so much seed is to learn about that pretty common feature now, on the other hand, now let's bring up Google that side. It writes a lot, a lot, a lot of food.  \n",

Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features? Longing is with the Google. This is all true. Why A.P.I. and yes, with the help of a B A, you can do all such creatures like booking the father. Every tickets are things you wanted to see me like. That is large. Invent Whoville are logging in the Facebook. Now there's one pulse of eating Porter now Spacy. If everybody will be able to use these times of A.P.I. eyes for free that are high Johnson that it can get simply, he overused or some people may use it pours a swell. So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage. I signed up on the Google and take the permission of the rule the day I want to use your logger feature.  \n",

      "Hey, no problem at all. I'll give you a A.P.I. key so that if you make any nonsense activity, I can track you and tension down you. So this is your very, very basic example of how the A.P.I. key works. So yes, that is it. This isn't This is your A.P.I.. Now, there's no such extreme mumbo jumbo over the area. It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging.

And that is going to calculate with a whole complex Everything's and going on there. Give me the data of every village Rain are really not ready. So how do we start? I'm not gonna put a satellite up there, but what I can do is some people have done that already, and I can use the 80 eyes now, some of the FBI's are free, and some of them are not like Sina pim. Django will is a freak here that you can use. But if you're going to use the Google database and want to fix up everything up on nearly, uh, live in ways that we call as lively luring database that some of the art is free for the fireplace on, we'll talk about the fire ways in some other movies on. But if your user base is growing, you have to pay them as well. So that is why the maintenance costs sometimes is there little bit but on to it. Let's forget about all that thing in.  \n",

      "never, never, never develops any product. There are certain issues which are probably almost every time. Markers. Well, that problem is whenever you're designing a project, it was absolutely fine in your machine, the developer machine. But as soon as that product is being moved onto the production state, maybe onto servers or maybe somebody's else computer. Maybe your friends are maybe a manager. This computer. In that case, the product usually fails to work with the same performance or same optimization or the same level of working, even when that product has moved from one place to another place. Although here we're talking about the big skill products that include something like no django myfriend Javascript in all those stuffs just to give you a bare minimum. Basic example, whether you know of any bets site using PHP or maybe sp dot net. Whenever you work on that project and move the product onto the Web server, there are definitely some ardent uncertainties that markers. Maybe your images are not being loaded properly. Maybe the palace is a little bit different. All glitchy and solve these cases. That is a cla*sic example. When everything works on the developer machine but turn as it moves to another place. It doesn't work like that. So the cla*sic problem is it works on my machine. This further brings the cla*sic debate about a liver, saying it works absolutely fine on my machine. You can come and check. And while putting their product onto the production or any other machine, the other guys say is, Hey, you probably forgot to mention some of the dependencies if you might have installed while working on some other projects, and that's why the problem is occurring. So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.  \n",

Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook.

You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking.  \n",

This usually result complex database structures server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relation dBMs. This type of DBMs defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations. Unlike the network B M s our dBms does now support many to many relationships relational dBMs usually have pre defined data types that they can support. This is the most popular dBMs type in the market examples of relational database management systems include Oracle and microsoft SQL server object oriented relational dBMs. This type support stories of new data types that data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored the database have attributes for example gender or age and methods that define what to do with the data host green SQL L is an example of object oriented relational dBMs. So what is sql. \n",

We have four major types of DBMS called Hierarchical Network Relational and object oriented the most widely used DBms is the relational model the saves data in table formats.

It wasn't that long ago that want a company or product and machine learning in a offerings. He was considered novel now and my company is visiting to use machine learning and their products in some way it's rapidly becoming well an expect feature trust as we expect companies that have a website that works on your mobile device or perhaps I have a the day was come when it will be expected that our technology will be personalized and staple and self correcting as we use machine learning to make human tasks that are faster than before we can also look further into the future while machine learning can help us to test that we never could achieved on our own. Thankfully. It's not hard to take advantage of machine learning today. The Toy has gotten quite good all you need is data developers and a willingness to take the punch for our purposes. I sure the definition machine learning gestures five words using data to answer questions while wouldn't use that a short answer for an profile exam.

Because you we'll generally diverge from what we for for is plugins. So my then choose the thing this easy to manage on faster. Yeah so even to to run it as a combination graph even future has slowly started people to use like more like your combination frameworks like spark and how all those things right. So that then it pretty much means which what is just the base like now first where you only use. Yeah then I think if the performance is more or less on part and the ability to perform detail and work. It is much easier maybe than bigger with be because also the graph field plus minus which it good enough for you know running queries also can is connect it externally as graph lemme you guys can use it also. Yep okay and on the other side I was I'm also working on the building of vocabulary so more like a dynamic one so kind of setting a pipeline where if we want like to fifteen because I think AWS and even Google or and one day they accept only like two fifty six maximum of work or something like so so if you want to like get top to fifty based on three you based on frequency or something then we should be able to get so the idea is this kind of structure should be able to help us with building vocabulary and having like our own tags kind of topics and end.

So we showed have that but the ID need to use a mapping in the deploy itself instead of like adding it. Okay will that. But essentially we'll move the progress all to excel package and know common sections like the product manager all of the like no. Yeah. Alright one you you wanna to talk about see data with product changes. So good to so for we need to do the create I add it and we from so you so we are using that because that that this this so but I actually changed then they cover and have change because they are taking attending of value I have to plan that so I manually really created I and I better makes it working so my be week after actually and I had first I create a new workspace with where that and that it based that was channel but I need the group that you need up. So join I I just gave the anything but we need joined open signalling ID and other. So probably also that they can pa*s no no, we that's not create missing i a so can URL. So and this making that change of adding that goes for but looks like so it has to you see and that is just when do the change okay so so I think I think by by end the day today. How the present end ApI P and we don't update this provider in info district check anything you see right manually. So only we had things Url URL and number repository might items. What I'm am making the then all of times and making putting all object the so we're I to add more. So I think by end of it to today it should be come all back in and changes should be done and know working thing is like I should I had that we start in the checking and design that they will do oh will but that cannot not change going from the way video see we for now we relying on the that get from Janice Janice. So we are more of it than start looking right right. So what if you say check that we about question. But once once we have this figure that but it is locked to none we get more from that also for. Yeah, so can live one guys decided market other than that one track back. Yeah is so let's a update you already know the AWS transcript production this morning we also deployed actually I we deploy the the API service ability to pa*s the static for vocabulary for improving ether. Okay so tested. It's also you know very slightly based on accidents if in and I will. A covers that the separate and based on your user use the appropriate one that all of that is done is just that you know the performance is arguably not as necessarily listened but does is able to identify things like ether meet as proper not and everything it's doing well. So once today actually gave me a better list to update but we know we have early limit on on the dictionary so AWS actually works in the way we originally wanted it to so you create a work capital offline okay and then you pa*s it the then we cannot Google. Unlike Google, but the limit essentially fifty the file. We can upload for the fifty eighty for vocabulary set that's pretty huge if we think about it, but again, the downside we have not occupied how much it affects performance definitely it takes huge. So we need to so that's where sort of kept it small right now and also you can only have a two hundred work vocabulary as sets in an account that is not a problem right now will think about later. So those are limitations. I just treating the vocabulary based on matrix feedback right now work on finish that okay. That's it right? There's nothing thing as so discuss. \n",

Logic little bit once you start before you working on it. Let's discuss once again and but if correct i mean high level that maybe there is a delay which recorded clients doesn't really get all the in the call before it able seen stream.

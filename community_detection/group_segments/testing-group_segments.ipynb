People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

But it's what makes possible all the interactivity we've come to expect and rely upon. But exactly what is an A.P.I.? It's a question everyone asks. Okay, not really. But we're glad you did the textbook definition go something like this in computer programming, an application programming interface is 17 sparkles okay to speak plainly. A.P.I. is the messenger that takes requests and tells the system what you want to d'oh and then return to the response back to you to give you a familiar example. Think oven A.P.I. as a We're in a restaurant. Imagine you're sitting at the table within menu of choices to order from, and the kitchen is the part of the system which will prepare your order. What's missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That's where the waiter or B P I comes in. Mm. The waiter is the messenger that takes your request order and tells the system in this case, the kitchen, what to do and then delivers a response back to you in this case, the food. Now that we've waited your appet*te, let's apply this to a really A.P.I. example. You are probably familiar with the process of searching for airline flights online. Just like at a restaurant, you have a menu of options to choose from a drop down menu. In this case, you choose to departure sea and date. I return city and state Kevin cla*s and other variables.

They all have A.P.I. eyes that allow computers to operate them, and that's what ultimately creates connectivity.

And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion.

So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.\"], \"2019-10-15T07:04:31Z\", \"2cd90f0674f348cc922acd6b8782ba0f\", \"e0705f59a3304272a602f2d329a80da5\"]}, \"132\": {\"segment0\": [[\"outdoor same tree of water to market Scarr Shell, which banks cla*s more shadow resistant that it's something innovative publicity stunt with the pasta box at the team of security personnel.

All right, so how do we use Docker installed Docker on your machine, and we'll provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which he built into a Docker image which could be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices.

Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name.

People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

Now that we've waited your appet*te, let's apply this to a really A.P.I. example. You are probably familiar with the process of searching for airline flights online. Just like at a restaurant, you have a menu of options to choose from a drop down menu. In this case, you choose to departure sea and date. I return city and state Kevin cla*s and other variables. In order to book your flight. You interact with the airline's website to access the airline's database to see if any seats are available on those dates and what the cost might be based on certain variables.

They all have A.P.I. eyes that allow computers to operate them, and that's what ultimately creates connectivity.

And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion.

So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.\"], \"2019-10-15T07:04:31Z\", \"2cd90f0674f348cc922acd6b8782ba0f\", \"e0705f59a3304272a602f2d329a80da5\"]}, \"132\": {\"segment0\": [[\"outdoor same tree of water to market Scarr Shell, which banks cla*s more shadow resistant that it's something innovative publicity stunt with the pasta box at the team of security personnel.

Their own isolated CPU processes, memory and network resource is, and because of this that could be easily added, removed, stopped and started again without affecting each other or the host machine containers usually run one specific tasks, such as a high school database or a know JS application and then their network together and potentially scaled it. Developer will usually start by accessing the Docker hug, an online cloud repository of Docker containers, and pulled one containing a pre configured environment for their specific programming language such as Ruby or No. J s.

Not only that, Docker uses less space to as it is able to reuse files efficiently by using a layered files, you have multiple Docker images using the same base image. For instance, Docker will only keep a single copy of the most needed and share them with each container. All right, so how do we use Docker installed Docker on your machine, and we'll provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which he built into a Docker image which could be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices. From there, you can run commands such as downloading, installing and running. Your software, of course, will link the docks below. Once they're Docker file is complete.

Once complete, you can verify your images Existence with Dr Images logger builds image can run a container of that image where you can push it to the cloud to share with others. Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name. You may also include a tag if one is available, which may specify a version or variant of this software.

People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion.

So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.\"], \"2019-10-15T07:04:31Z\", \"2cd90f0674f348cc922acd6b8782ba0f\", \"e0705f59a3304272a602f2d329a80da5\"]}, \"132\": {\"segment0\": [[\"outdoor same tree of water to market Scarr Shell, which banks cla*s more shadow resistant that it's something innovative publicity stunt with the pasta box at the team of security personnel.

For instance, Docker will only keep a single copy of the most needed and share them with each container. All right, so how do we use Docker installed Docker on your machine, and we'll provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which he built into a Docker image which could be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices.

Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name.

People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion.

So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.\"], \"2019-10-15T07:04:31Z\", \"2cd90f0674f348cc922acd6b8782ba0f\", \"e0705f59a3304272a602f2d329a80da5\"]}, \"132\": {\"segment0\": [[\"outdoor same tree of water to market Scarr Shell, which banks cla*s more shadow resistant that it's something innovative publicity stunt with the pasta box at the team of security personnel.

For instance, Docker will only keep a single copy of the most needed and share them with each container. All right, so how do we use Docker installed Docker on your machine, and we'll provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which he built into a Docker image which could be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices.

Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name.

People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion.

So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.\"], \"2019-10-15T07:04:31Z\", \"2cd90f0674f348cc922acd6b8782ba0f\", \"e0705f59a3304272a602f2d329a80da5\"]}, \"132\": {\"segment0\": [[\"outdoor same tree of water to market Scarr Shell, which banks cla*s more shadow resistant that it's something innovative publicity stunt with the pasta box at the team of security personnel.

For instance, Docker will only keep a single copy of the most needed and share them with each container. All right, so how do we use Docker installed Docker on your machine, and we'll provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which he built into a Docker image which could be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices.

Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name.

People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion.

So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C.

Please leave US review and basically a believer review. Then you could take him out. If they don't, you could maybe wait this time like a month, say, about a month ago. We work with you. If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday. Being dead, you can send out a text message to your V I P list and hey, come in 10 bucks off your meal and you can fill up that inventory. It's gonna be better to give a discount than not have a sale. It all right, So text messages allow you to do that and you automate that whole process. So bonus tip of the day. For all this to occur, you need a good marketing platform. You need a C R M that's connected to your marketing Cross channel Google, Facebook instagram being all that right, and you need marketing automation building and you need a text message marketing built in. So it's hard to find a platform that does all that, but that's what you need to be successful.\"], \"2019-10-15T07:04:31Z\", \"2cd90f0674f348cc922acd6b8782ba0f\", \"e0705f59a3304272a602f2d329a80da5\"]}, \"132\": {\"segment0\": [[\"outdoor same tree of water to market Scarr Shell, which banks cla*s more shadow resistant that it's something innovative publicity stunt with the pasta box at the team of security personnel.

Docker is mainly a software development platform and kind of a virtualization makes it easier for us to develop and deploy.

Their own isolated CPU processes, memory and network resource is, and because of this that could be easily added, removed, stopped and started again without affecting each other or the host machine containers usually run one specific tasks, such as a high school database or a know JS application and then their network together and potentially scaled it. Developer will usually start by accessing the Docker hug, an online cloud repository of Docker containers, and pulled one containing a pre configured environment for their specific programming language such as Ruby or No. J s.

Not only that, Docker uses less space to as it is able to reuse files efficiently by using a layered files, you have multiple Docker images using the same base image. For instance, Docker will only keep a single copy of the most needed and share them with each container. All right, so how do we use Docker installed Docker on your machine, and we'll provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which he built into a Docker image which could be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The Docker file is a surprisingly simple text doc*ment that instructs how the Docker image will be built like a blueprint. You first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the Docker hub like we mentioned before a bunch of an Alpine lennox or popular choices. From there, you can run commands such as downloading, installing and running. Your software, of course, will link the docks below. Once they're Docker file is complete.

Once complete, you can verify your images Existence with Dr Images logger builds image can run a container of that image where you can push it to the cloud to share with others. Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name. You may also include a tag if one is available, which may specify a version or variant of this software.

For example, your name, age, height, weight, et cetera are some data related to you in picture image file on PDM, etcetera can all be considered data, you know. What is it? Date Way already know what data is? But this data could be random. A database is a systematic collection of data. Since the data and the data bases organized, it makes data management easy. What is a database management system? DBM s data makes management system or D B. M s is a collection of programs which enables its users to access the database, manipulate data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people, phone numbers and other contact details. Your electricity service provider is obviously using a d. B. M s to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data, et cetera. Let's consider the Facebook it needs to store manipulate and present data related to members. They're friends, member activities, messages, advertis***nts and a lot more. We can provide countless numbers of examples for usage of D. B. M s database management systems are not a new concept and as such had been first implemented in the 19 sixties. \n",

This delay increases the pressure of staying compet*tive because some compet*tors are able to deploy new products and features much faster.

The number of servers that she needs to administer constantly growing because her company continues to launch new products and customers are consuming more of their service is this increase of servers has caused some challenges for an the tools that she used to administer.

So what could be done to help David Anna work better multi bility. They want the same thing. Happy customers. What if Dave, the developer and Anna from operations, work better together, thought or like broke down silos share responsibility. This would require them to change their mind set on half dead and ops work. So what is Devils? Dev-ops integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure. Automating work flows on by continuously measuring application performance. If Anna and Dave's teams were more dev-ops for it, they would do a few things differently. They would place more focus on automation. Dev-ops teams try to automate everything from testing a new code to how infrastructure is provisions. They would write software and small chunks that are integrated tested, monitored and deploy usually an hour's, versus a traditional way of writing large chunks of software over weeks or months and then do weeks or months of testing. Plus, they will have identical development and production environments based on the same configurations. Writing small chunks of code will allow them to increase the frequency of deployments and improve the time to deploy new coat. It also enables them to adopt a generative process to monitor, measured and improve the coat and operations every day, improved their ability to respond to market needs or other things that impact software instead of building and configuring software. \n",

As a result, they will have the ability to build infrastructure at scale to dozens, hundreds or even thousands of servers in multiple locations using different types of hardware. Another change that a dev-ops pour into team would do is to use a source control system to help manage track, doc*ment all of the changes to both application code and configuration management. Coat The change that and David Implement is to adopt a discipline of application, performance, monitoring and optimization and almost real time. This will out David and the rest of his developers to understand the performance impact of their changes. The ultimate goal is to have a production environment that gives their customers a great experience. So one benefit is having a devil app-store into teams, and Dave's coming well. It allows up to increase the rate of software delivery and improves the company's time to market potentially for months and weeks, two days and hours. This will be a huge compet*tive advantage. It also allowed them to a better business focus by automating their infrastructure so that they could focus on things that improve the business and their online content. They will spend more time on these activities that add more value to the organization. When a company is able to build an offer better products, this means they have half your customers and happier developers. How does a dev-ops pour into team actually accomplish this? Well, as mentioned before, there needs to be a change in the mindset of the two crew sending to work closer together. The other component to the formula is getting the right tools. New tools are needed in this fast paced world. They will need a tool that allows him to build and test code. You asleep on example of this is Jenkins.

It's extremely helpful to monitor an environment, but now that many environments have hundreds or thousands of servers, new tools like new Relic are required to make sense of all this data. This will allow them to know how the entire application is performing and help them identify bottlenecks. But many companies don't know how to use these tools or do not have the skills to automate software delivery process. This is where Rackspace dev-ops automation service can help. In conclusion, dev-ops is a new philosophy that could help software organizations innovate faster and be more responsive to business needs. It promotes collaboration between developers and operations, which improves quality of software development and more frequent software releases. Adopting the dev-ops philosophy requires a vine.

Welcome to HR over coffee, a Siri's from the experts at HR 360 where you'll learn out of effectively higher managed and terminate employees. Theo Employee retention can be a pricey problem for any business. High turnover rates result in lost productivity and additional expenses, such as recruiting, hiring and training replacement employees. A general guideline is that replacing employee who voluntarily leaves cost about 25% of the positions total salary and benefits. Using these multipliers and employ earning a salary of $50,000 a year could cost more than $16,000 to replace. That's not accost you want to regularly absorb, so consider making retention a priority with these 10 resolutions. First, hire smart taking the time draft job descriptions. Recruit candidates that interview thoroughly will pay off to find employees who are a good fit for the position and the unique culture of your company or organization. Next, offer a fair and compet*tive compensation package. No the normal for the position, your industry and your area of the country. Do your research ahead of time as you hire employees. So the greatest extent you can offer an attractive benefits program, including items such as medical insurance, a portal, one K or other retirement savings plan, or even perks. Such a subsidized health club memberships. Also training mentor your employees, help them set goals for both their role in the company and overall career and provide support to help them get there.

A recent came across your postings on YouTube, and I would f**k. That's the entrepreneur. Trinity. Thank you, Jerry. I'm I've been And the transportation, just six field for over 10 years of expanded her first. Then if they get more exposure, maybe start up the great work, Governor Jerry. So there is a great question and congratulations on having the guy was gonna cost you money on What you need to do is test this. Say, is there actually a need for this? So you think there's a need is their action. It will unskilled labor give you their contact information? And then will the whole deport sears? Whoever pay you to make that service half right. And you could start it without an app started just by getting people's phone numbers and you can send text messages to them. The problem. We're likely to pay attention to a text, then thio anyway, But you could start that right now. Right? You could start building your list of skilled labor to say if you ever wanted the delivery service is or whatever service is last minute, I need people. Here's how much approximately gonna make from it. Give me your phone number and I'll text you any time I get a job. That's how you start when you build your list and you ask them for friends and you, you start small. You're testing it to see if it works. Don't go spending money on an app that you lose time on your best in your dollars into and you don't know what's gonna work or not and solely on trains go down that road where they say, Here's my new plan. If I sell these all these dollars in time and created this thing and then it doesn't work out where is better than tested right away on a small scale as quickly as you can. So that's my advice.

Wasted number to start local start with a geographic area close to you is going to be easy and ideal. And again, we're testing this thing out on a small scale. Local workers. Okay, You target the 10 local home depots in Sears and all that that are close to you and the local workers who are all around you. And you start with that. You see, if it worked to see if we can get them to sign up, you see if you can get them to give you their their full numbers. You can send them text messages. That's give me the easier side, right? To get their information to say I may have a job for you. Send me your number and I can send you a text. We have something that should get easier side. Isn't King deliver too? The Home Depot. So Home Depot calls and says, Hey, yeah, we need three people to come and deliver the same can you actually deliver? And so you test local task Small. You're gonna make some mistakes. You figure out along the way on then, As you move up, number three is He proved the concept, right? We're gonna make mistakes along the way home people is going to say, you know, you didn't give me my people in time for the wrong people or they didn't do what I ask. They didn't speak English or whatever the criteria is that they need. But you're gonna make mistakes, but you're gonna learn from them and you're gonna make it better. And maybe the solution is gonna be Hey, we did that for this. Maybe the solution is that the unskilled workers, they would love it out. And maybe the Home Depot guys would love with a log in and just press a few b**tons and have some workers show up. Right? Maybe that's saying solution, but you're not gonna know that right now, right? Proved the concept, show that it works, and then you can slowly expand and see if you are the home people.

Welcome to HR over coffee, a Siri's from the experts at HR 360 where you'll learn out of effectively higher managed and terminate employees. Theo Employee retention can be a pricey problem for any business. High turnover rates result in lost productivity and additional expenses, such as recruiting, hiring and training replacement employees. A general guideline is that replacing employee who voluntarily leaves cost about 25% of the positions total salary and benefits. Using these multipliers and employ earning a salary of $50,000 a year could cost more than $16,000 to replace. That's not accost you want to regularly absorb, so consider making retention a priority with these 10 resolutions. First, hire smart taking the time draft job descriptions. Recruit candidates that interview thoroughly will pay off to find employees who are a good fit for the position and the unique culture of your company or organization. Next, offer a fair and compet*tive compensation package. No the normal for the position, your industry and your area of the country. Do your research ahead of time as you hire employees. So the greatest extent you can offer an attractive benefits program, including items such as medical insurance, a portal, one K or other retirement savings plan, or even perks. Such a subsidized health club memberships. Also training mentor your employees, help them set goals for both their role in the company and overall career and provide support to help them get there.

      "Welcome to today's a 360. My name is Bruce turn Olson, and today we're gonna be talking about why as many people as possible should be learning Sequel Secret or SQL stands for structured Querida language. It's the primary language responsible for managing data, and data structures can came within relation all database systems. So any time you're trying to retrieve data from a database, add data to a database or make any modifications to the data structures, you're probably going to be using some variant of the sequel for SQL Language. Let's get into the first reason why I believe you should learn sequel First, you can earn some great money, your next potential for somebody with strong sequel skills. It's pretty significant if you're a financial a**lyst or anybody who's XL Guru but lacks the sequel. Knowledge Learning Sequel might be the next step for you to really progress your career and identify an opportunity for a high earning job around with. The high earning potential sequels are the most sought after skills by employers that are hiring. This makes sense, given the emphasis on a**lytics in the growth of data, so it wouldn't apply that employers are looking for a warrant for individuals with the talent to retrieve data from a database using sequel and know what to do with him and run with the career oriented reasons for learning Sequel never means that you might want to learn secrets because it enables you to get an answer to any question that you asked. If you're an inquisitive person and want to know as much as possible about your business sequel enables you to think of those questions and then get an answer to those questions without having to go to a bunch of different people trying to find answers. If you're somebody who works in Excel a lot, how many times have you worked really big spread? She tried to create some formula. \n",

      "pim operation in Excel crashes. Yes, it's gotten better with newer versions, but it still happens. Secret eliminates that. Crash it by writing a sequel, query or building some type of secret code or swept and running it against the database. That system is designed to process millions and millions and millions of rose very quickly. It's designed to the efficient for a lot of the quarters that you're gonna write. So if you're somebody dressed to deal with Excel, crashing frequently because of the volume or types of operations you try to do with data sequel is going to enable you to overcome that obstacle and be more efficient. The last reason we're gonna talk about as to why you should learn sequel is that it enables you to never have to ask yourself a question like How did I make that report again? Secret queries could be saved and easily rerun at any point in time. So if there's something that has many steps to record is a little bit more complicated instead of having to re do all your work, you can see that clearly when you need to run it again, you just simply open it up and executed. While there are certainly some things that you could do with it, except to be more efficient with your report, automate certain things through V. P. A. Or power pivot or something like that, Secret is going to make that process much, much easier. So I get Sequel is going to enable you to be incredibly efficient and not waste any time by redoing manual processes that could simply be opened up from your safe Really executed. And while you have the results so wrap it up, you should learn in secret because of a higher earning potential. It's one of the most in demand skills. It empowers you to answer your own questions of your data. You will really have to deal with Excel crashing if you write your queries and sequel against a database, and you won't have to redo nearly as much manual effort because you can save your queries usually open and then you run them at any time.

If you wouldn't mind taking the seconds in this review to see how this could go kind of on forever, do the same process with literally anything. Automate your communications to your customers on the male side. Automate your text message marketing. This is similar to email the text messages or a little bit different. This is something small business owners don't take advantage of, like I think they should, because text messages are opened in almost 100% open right? I mean, it's insane, whereas e mails more like 20% area. The other thing is, text messages were opened in basically real time. People look at those things within five minutes whereas email, you know, few days so text messages a little different in terms of the user experience and some examples of how you can take advantage of that is, for example, get somebody to opt in. Buy a nice call to action on your website like, hey, text, you know, go to 39970 and get an instant 50% off coupon, your first visit and then get V I p deals after that along the way. This is amazing because this is perfect for, like, vic sales days or filling empty inventory such as a restaurant on a Tuesday.

How do different devices and applications connect with each other to allow us to place an order, make a reservation? Who are book a flight, just Theo eyes code-push in programs or A.P.I.? What's the engine under the hood? And is behind the scenes that we take for granted? But it's what makes possible all the interactivity we've come to expect and rely upon. But exactly what is an A.P.I.? It's a question everyone asks. Okay, not really. But we're glad you did the textbook definition go something like this in computer programming, an application programming interface is 17 sparkles okay to speak plainly. A.P.I. is the messenger that takes requests and tells the system what you want to d'oh and then return to the response back to you to give you a familiar example. Think oven A.P.I. as a We're in a restaurant. Imagine you're sitting at the table within menu of choices to order from, and the kitchen is the part of the system which will prepare your order. What's missing is the critical link to communicate your order to the kitchen and deliver your food back to your table. That's where the waiter or B P I comes in. Mm. The waiter is the messenger that takes your request order and tells the system in this case, the kitchen, what to do and then delivers a response back to you in this case, the food. Now that we've waited your appet*te, let's apply this to a really A.P.I. example. You are probably familiar with the process of searching for airline flights online. Just like at a restaurant, you have a menu of options to choose from a drop down menu. In this case, you choose to departure sea and date. I return city and state Kevin cla*s and other variables. In order to book your flight. You interact with the airline's website to access the airline's database to see if any seats are available on those dates and what the cost might be based on certain variables. But what if you're not using the airline's website.  \n",

      "which has direct access to the information. What if you were using an online travel service that aggregates information from many different airlines? The travel service interacts with the airlines. A.P.I. Tthe e A.P.I. is an interface that, like you're helpful. Waiter can be asked by that online travel service to get information from the airline system over the Internet to book seats, choose Neil Preferences or baggage options. It also then takes the airlines response to requests and delivers it right back to the online travel service, which then shows it to you. So now you can see that it's A.P.I. eyes that make it possible for us all to use travel sites. The same goes for all interactions between applications, data and devices. They all have A.P.I. eyes that allow computers to operate them, and that's what ultimately creates connectivity. So whenever you think of a A.P.I., just think of it as your waiter running back and forth between applications, databases and devices to deliver data and create the connectivity that puts the world at our fingertips. And whenever you think of creating an A.P.I., think mules oft.  \n",

So that was your experience design. Anyways. It was about what, When, where, Why, how and who would use this to product once we have understood that n**es and once a user and we could design an awesome solution for them. But you don't throw the road. Usually there are many different kinds of creative people collaborating together. It's like a Jan your party, right ISS. This creative people bring in route skills to the table. Let's take your smartphone, for example. So for speaking, the returns very obvious areas of design Here. One is a design of the app-store on your phone, and the other is a design of the phone. It's cache. Let's talk about the apse. First, let's take a nap that you probably use every day like you're texting up one of the first steps in Creating an APP is to define the problem without a problem. It doesn't make sense to create a solution right height. But anyways, who difference that problem? Usually it was a researcher does.

And through that they start to see patterns and the user's gave you based on, which is about the means, And that is how they define a problem Now. Next comes the interaction designer. Take this problem and design a solution for it. They start off with all kinds of hand st*tched concepts and then turn it into higher fidelity white frames. And then they about the design into a broken prototype and broken prototype is tested and measured and a**lyzed with a whole bunch of losers. Sounds pretty scientific, right? We're from those tests, but they use a researcher in the direction designer are able to figure out that should have phoned me up. And what shouldn't and they just tweak the design made him many times to get a just perfect. Now we have a perfect solution to the problem. But wait, it's not over yet. Another Christian stepping over at pa*ses isn't making this solution and in this case, are texting up. Look beautiful. There's the handiwork of a visual designer creates turn the feel of the up. A visual designer focuses on things like local typeface and lay out a color scheme. So now we not only have a solution, but it is a beautiful solution. So phone we talked about the design process. Have a nap. That's very sure you talk about what it takes to design the from itself. A.P.I. design Hybrid products like your phone, your car leaving your vacuum cleaner.

Our experienced designers put up much of every industry you could possibly think of from food scare researching prototyping, iterating and testing to create products that are used from usable and delightful. She let me ask about those user experience matter well around losers of products and services. If these products and service is worth designed for us losing right, what you lose the texting app that wouldn't you texted me. It was a morning. No, but if I don't design for user's and you do get it right, this means you can create strong, positive relationships between the company set out for the product, and the people prevents it. So the next time you were at a restaurant or think about for even just texting the fund? No, but there was a hope of creative people behind your experience, making it only unendurable as pa*sport.

A lot of times, people think that's just e mail, but it's so much more than that. So what I'm gonna do is walking through four different examples of how we use marketing automation. And maybe you could get some ideas of how you could use it for yourself to really grill your brand to the next level. So let's jump in quick tip. Before we jump into these examples, let's make sure that you spend time setting up good and campaigns both on the channel side outside multi channel work, YouTube, Facebook, instagram, where are they? And then what's the type of content they wantto see? There's this saying content is king, but marketing is queen, and that's so true. You have to have great content first. And then it's about where you're placing that content that's really key to success. That's where the queen comes in and write. The queen's always in charge. So let's think about how we could do that. Walk through these examples so example Number one Once you set up this initial automates the ad funnel. So about this, well, maybe it's a Google search on Google. They come to your website once they come to your website automatic campaign. You haven't thought of me showing them different a*s promotion. Maybe for the next 30 days way Maybe, I mean, is that you show that to automated way. \n",

      "ads. So not email actual digital ads as they're surfing the Internet that they're staying an automated way. And eventually, if you're doing that, they will come, for example, number to automate your social media with regards to Target. Here's an example. You run an ad on Facebook, right? Let's say it's a video, and you can then set up a campaign. If somebody watches that video for 15% or more, that they're entered into another campaign that targets those people with a different ad for a different video. And if they watch a certain percentage of that, they could be entered into another campaign so that they're seeing different content over time, which is maybe helping them through that fine process until they are ready to convert. So think about that convergence on that path really automated. If you set up a good initial campaign, then it's really hands free. After that example, Number three is spotted me at your email communications. So what I mean by that is when somebody's describes for they convert on your Web site or a social ad. Now, rather than just showing them digital ads, you can actually send an e mails automated way. So, for example, maybe you have a C. R M. And when you convert somebody from a cold lied tow a hot lead in your C. Aram, you automatically set up the campaign that sends them an email that talks about X y Z right, and then seven days later it sends him another email, and then seven days later it's in another email. This is completely automated, So when somebody converts on her site, you can build a drip campaign of emails and automated way that keeps the communication going until eventually they convert example Number four Automate your customer emails. So by that I mean, here's a good example. Maybe this is to build reviews reputation when you mark somebody in your C. R m Okay, from something like a pending project to completed project when they enter into the completed project, you can automatically send them an email that says, Hey, we appreciate your business.

      "Welcome to today's a 360. My name is Bruce turn Olson, and today we're gonna be talking about why as many people as possible should be learning Sequel Secret or SQL stands for structured Querida language. It's the primary language responsible for managing data, and data structures can came within relation all database systems. So any time you're trying to retrieve data from a database, add data to a database or make any modifications to the data structures, you're probably going to be using some variant of the sequel for SQL Language. Let's get into the first reason why I believe you should learn sequel First, you can earn some great money, your next potential for somebody with strong sequel skills. It's pretty significant if you're a financial a**lyst or anybody who's XL Guru but lacks the sequel. Knowledge Learning Sequel might be the next step for you to really progress your career and identify an opportunity for a high earning job around with. The high earning potential sequels are the most sought after skills by employers that are hiring. This makes sense, given the emphasis on a**lytics in the growth of data, so it wouldn't apply that employers are looking for a warrant for individuals with the talent to retrieve data from a database using sequel and know what to do with him and run with the career oriented reasons for learning Sequel never means that you might want to learn secrets because it enables you to get an answer to any question that you asked. If you're an inquisitive person and want to know as much as possible about your business sequel enables you to think of those questions and then get an answer to those questions without having to go to a bunch of different people trying to find answers. If you're somebody who works in Excel a lot, how many times have you worked really big spread? She tried to create some formula. \n",

      "pim operation in Excel crashes. Yes, it's gotten better with newer versions, but it still happens. Secret eliminates that. Crash it by writing a sequel, query or building some type of secret code or swept and running it against the database. That system is designed to process millions and millions and millions of rose very quickly. It's designed to the efficient for a lot of the quarters that you're gonna write. So if you're somebody dressed to deal with Excel, crashing frequently because of the volume or types of operations you try to do with data sequel is going to enable you to overcome that obstacle and be more efficient. The last reason we're gonna talk about as to why you should learn sequel is that it enables you to never have to ask yourself a question like How did I make that report again? Secret queries could be saved and easily rerun at any point in time. So if there's something that has many steps to record is a little bit more complicated instead of having to re do all your work, you can see that clearly when you need to run it again, you just simply open it up and executed. While there are certainly some things that you could do with it, except to be more efficient with your report, automate certain things through V. P. A. Or power pivot or something like that, Secret is going to make that process much, much easier. So I get Sequel is going to enable you to be incredibly efficient and not waste any time by redoing manual processes that could simply be opened up from your safe Really executed. And while you have the results so wrap it up, you should learn in secret because of a higher earning potential. It's one of the most in demand skills. It empowers you to answer your own questions of your data. You will really have to deal with Excel crashing if you write your queries and sequel against a database, and you won't have to redo nearly as much manual effort because you can save your queries usually open and then you run them at any time. If you are interested in learning secret, we have a great course out there on the.  \n",

Speaking of sharing with others, if you don't create your own Docker image in, you just want to use a premade one component from the Docker hub using Docker pole and the image name.

RDM Server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational T B M s. This type of D B. M s defines database relationships in forms of tables, also known as relations. Unlike the network, D B M S R D B M s does not support many too many relationships. Relation A ll d B. M s usually have predefined data types that they can support. This is the most popular TV M s type in the market. Examples of relation A ll database management systems include my SQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server Object oriented Relation a ll d B m s This type support storage of new data types that dated to be stored is in the form of objects. The objects to be stored in the database have attributes, for example, gender or age and methods that define what to do with the data. Postgres SQL is an example of object oriented relation a ll d B M s So what is SQL?.  \n",

You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like.

What is it? A set of function in procedure that allows to create of application which access for a feature or date, often operating system. Application of other service is again a bamboo jungle. That means we don't get it. What disease Yet? The problem is this definition is perfectly correct on the people who are using the A.P.I. will be saying that, Hey, this is a perfect definition and perfect point. Understand? Here's the problem. The people who are already using the A.P.I. I don't mean to understand. What is it? Yeah, because they know about it. But the people who don't understand the FBI, we need to target at people.

This one, hopefully always that when you try to book an airline ticket, you book it from a based website. Let us say you want to fly from Jeff. Tried any your jumper to Mumbai on YouTube, your favorite Indian airlines. But how many times do you actually built from Indigo Airlines? You really does. That you use other service is like make my trip dot com or maybe go anywhere dot com or any other self service is. So how is that possible that you're looking from the third party Web site, but still you're getting a seat on the same plane? The answer is A.P.I.. Now, before I move ahead and talk a little bit more about it, let's want over animation section and give you an example that you're already using off the idea. Now let's try to understand what is this A.P.I. and we're gonna use a simple example that you. Some of you might have already beat. So let me bring up my own website here. Some of you might have wondered who destroyed on this website, and I would just say Woo hoo, self promotion. So now let's get it on and forward that you might have seen that on this website. He used a kind of a feature known a sign up. I thought, this sign of features pretty common. You just registered in your name, email address, pa*sport and then I send you information even at your email and use. Click on that paper that this spending my day off, paddling the sign up Pretty common. Nothing so important.

Now we also know that there's one of the very important people who live to sign in peach. If you probably have been using that party, man, are you two? So there's a lot of future already being cooked up by the pool. So one of the code feature is an organ system. Now, give Somehow I can use the group logger and system that it would be really awesome because Google has already taken care of things like verifying off the user of twenties authenticity of the user. So it's already being done there. On if you notice that on our website, which is learning code online Docker, we use a piece of known as the one place you could excuse that. So what I'm using there is I'm using some of the food Britain by Google, which is a bargain in this case, and try to incorporate that in my Vette site. Now, although this ent*tled code is written by the Google, but I don't have to worry about what they ever turn, how they have. I'm just fixing a few of my meaningful and using the features off the Google that they have provided for me on how actually am I am I to do so? How am I even provide new features?

So there's one more concept that sometime is introduced, also known as A.P.I. Key. Now A.P.I., these again have met their baggage.

It is the simplest thing in the world. But yet the definition has made it so complex here now onto a somebody node, I would say that yes, A.P.I. is just a code written by someone else that I don't really bother how it is being rich white is being region or what the circ*mstances would have bean that what these people have written this code. All I get about this, this is someone else code is legally giving me permission to use that code. And I can use that in my application. For example, logging into this Google are logging.

So this debate is pretty nasty. Docker is designed to specifically addressed this exact problem. It works on my machine. First and foremost, Docker is just completely a different thing, and it's compatible with almost any programming language of any project that you're working on. It's like almost a sheet of paper on which you can put up anything. It's almost like that. Docker allows you to have absolutely sealed tight.  \n",

Now we can dig this container and bay where you're going to put this country that it's gonna look at absolutely and exactly like how it worked on the AR machine. Not only that, Docker, also those who have social containers What does that mean? The containers are shared just like your social status on your instagram or Facebook. It allows you to publish these containers onto a social Slack bomb. Well, the cla*sic example is, whenever you're learning my SQL, installing the Maya skin can be very challenging. I'm not talking about the GHB Paschal package. I'm talking about just the score, my a*s. Cuba. It's one of the most challenging thing. Prince falls onto your system and I personally have felt in the boot Ganz that waas somebody's running Windows, Mac and violence. It's not easy Call Sister do so, but that process can be done frictionless with the help of soccer. So Docker is a software that allows you to greet these container and these containers are not just any container. They're super powerful on our super bagged up and concerns a lot of banks. He's the dinner are abducted, your gold, your dependencies, your conflagration, some of the processes that you're running from the networking information that you're running. And in some of the special cases, it also consists off the chunk off some of the operating system that is responsible off tweaking out Something's in your code. So in order. Summarize. Megan, divide this stalker into three main essential thing that it does for you. Number one thing. It's a client side application program. You can just install the Docker and windows all the things for you, including designing that container for you. And you don't have to worry about anything, all of the codes and contentment, and you could just move it anywhere you like. Docker can also act as a service and can be deployed onto any server so that you can take your container and can be deployed on any place you like. Docker also act as a social networking.  \n",

I was working on that Recorder Server termination logic is working for meaning the code is half then I have yesterday date like for example, let's if by up stop if I stopped the instance from a control right now it is giving recorder repeat done and because I have not added a new, but this does the work. So I'm sending the code an case for it and also try to integrate web okay message. If you saying that recorder is done this we can do this. This same meeting is terminate for Andre. They don't care that but my he's on switched in the call in the call. The message to that would be meeting but combination or something because they don't care what whether. Breaking up way we can Sync up later but yeah, right? I'm on track with be web. He's like come here right now. For the call yes where we earlier my left ten. So when we list the later and maybe let's talk about time. \n",

      " Text:  I think it's for most part we just want you whether the graph then doing any graph applying a graph algorithms on it any anyways right? Because you we'll generally diverge from what we for for is plugins. So my then choose the thing this easy to manage on faster. Yeah so even to to run it as a combination graph even future has slowly started people to use like more like your combination frameworks like spark and how all those things right. So that then it pretty much means which what is just the base like now first where you only use. Yeah then I think if the performance is more or less on part and the ability to perform detail and work. It is much easier maybe than bigger with be because also the graph field plus minus which it good enough for you know running queries also can is connect it externally as graph lemme you guys can use it also. Yep okay and on the other side I was I'm also working on the building of vocabulary so more like a dynamic one so kind of setting a pipeline where if we want like to fifteen because I think AWS and even Google or and one day they accept only like two fifty six maximum of work or something like so so if you want to like get top to fifty based on three you based on frequency or something then we should be able to get so the idea is this kind of structure should be able to help us with building vocabulary and having like our own tags kind of topics and end. So plays like a word like GPU or in markets then we should have a a*sociated meaning to it. So that we can use it for the future for maybe topic extraction or something else.

So we showed have that but the ID need to use a mapping in the deploy itself instead of like adding it. Okay will that. But essentially we'll move the progress all to excel package and know common sections like the product manager all of the like no. Yeah. Alright one you you wanna to talk about see data with product changes. So good to so for we need to do the create I add it and we from so you so we are using that because that that this this so but I actually changed then they cover and have change because they are taking attending of value I have to plan that so I manually really created I and I better makes it working so my be week after actually and I had first I create a new workspace with where that and that it based that was channel but I need the group that you need up. So join I I just gave the anything but we need joined open signalling ID and other. So probably also that they can pa*s no no, we that's not create missing i a so can URL. So and this making that change of adding that goes for but looks like so it has to you see and that is just when do the change okay so so I think I think by by end the day today. How the present end ApI P and we don't update this provider in info district check anything you see right manually. So only we had things Url URL and number repository might items. What I'm am making the then all of times and making putting all object the so we're I to add more. So I think by end of it to today it should be come all back in and changes should be done and know working thing is like I should I had that we start in the checking and design that they will do oh will but that cannot not change going from the way video see we for now we relying on the that get from Janice Janice. So we are more of it than start looking right right. So what if you say check that we about question. But once once we have this figure that but it is locked to none we get more from that also for. Yeah, so can live one guys decided market other than that one track back. Yeah is so let's a update you already know the AWS transcript production this morning we also deployed actually I we deploy the the API service ability to pa*s the static for vocabulary for improving ether. Okay so tested. It's also you know very slightly based on accidents if in and I will. A covers that the separate and based on your user use the appropriate one that all of that is done is just that you know the performance is arguably not as necessarily listened but does is able to identify things like ether meet as proper not and everything it's doing well. So once today actually gave me a better list to update but we know we have early limit on on the dictionary so AWS actually works in the way we originally wanted it to so you create a work capital offline okay and then you pa*s it the then we cannot Google. Unlike Google, but the limit essentially fifty the file. We can upload for the fifty eighty for vocabulary set that's pretty huge if we think about it, but again, the downside we have not occupied how much it affects performance definitely it takes huge. So we need to so that's where sort of kept it small right now and also you can only have a two hundred work vocabulary as sets in an account that is not a problem right now will think about later. So those are limitations. I just treating the vocabulary based on matrix feedback right now work on finish that okay. That's it right? There's nothing thing as so discuss. \n",

Logic little bit once you start before you working on it. Let's discuss once again and but if correct i mean high level that maybe there is a delay which recorded clients doesn't really get all the in the call before it able seen stream. So that's probably the issue because I added laws on that call to client it immediately trigger us an end when I joined. before us that recording client's fee new and shows of like a participant, the end is signalled on the referee.

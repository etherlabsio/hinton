      "You try to find like the number of distinct chapters happening in a discussion and then for each chapter, so you go and find the highlights.\n",
      "So the bulbs are highlights the chapters are the whole trying to cover the whole uniqueness of the discussion.\n",
      "So I would be so it is a new URL.\n",
      "Subject of peace and humanely tell that we should have expected.\n",
      "This will be Topic in his essentially.\n",
      "That Shane was also asking me to making sentences down that I interned under sentences for each unique object the beginning here.\n",
      "The next sentence is a text when a field called text and a hiding with the sentence belong funny.\n",
      "It was pretty to some for sentences.\n",
      "But the name Remains the Same or itself should be different, right?\n",
      "And just dump everything on Tinder like the current chapters like four chapters chapter summary.\n",
      "Is it only for triggering summary or is it about doing anything?\n",
      "So if one segment splits, it has multiple sentences.\n",
      "He will go give us a key phrases for that.\n",
      "If I had to push back to slack with two sections one is topics and one of the actions.\n",
      "Topics were interspersed with manual markers and we would remove any overlapping chapters within that range that you would protect yourself perfectly fit in with that.\n",
      "We found something for you as a topic and within that time range itself be graded on someone read a manual marker.\n",
      "We will not contain all the sentences from the original segment, but only the Filter Works.\n",
      "Let is assume that there is a threshold in the characterization anything about that would flow as a topics below that would not do not go as topics.\n",
      "They are like either is relevant or something, but it is that is what so if that is it on high level of difference between chapters.\n",
      "But essentially the idea is the same thing, right if we could use the highlighter topics.\n",
      "It would definitely be using the anything else great, except the Alta text.\n",
      "That is that is our first group a number of key phrases, right?\n",
      "So we have only somebody if the action it is, the said you have the summary of the discussion you show them all the topics that we think are important.\n",
      "Yeah, but when we say we found topic we give them a list of subtopics and everything, right?\n",
      "We need to First other words coming back and then decide how this will be.\n",
      "You do not necessarily have to correlate to a topic.\n",
      "Then what is does is like for every discussion just give the highlights.\n",
      "Yeah, if you say highlights from the paint and what happens to the rest of the documents that is covered in chapters.\n",
      "Like the chapter gives you the whole idea like the separation in different different topics and the problems just give you highlights what is important for each topic, but when you put the consumer in the same place, maybe it is okay.\n",
      "So if you if you want to know Or even nine third chapters as well.\n",
      "Well come up with something how we represent that information we can change it, but for now keep that as a feature separate from what you are doing right now you are trying to To distinguish the essential topics in a Convent in a complete conversation.\n",
      "But with some caveats here and there but it is not necessarily going to be completed the same as every five minute keywords that we do right wrong.\n",
      "Well figure out how to represent that information and deprecated the way we do it is show information timeline right now, but let us not, you know.\n",
      "They compare both so go to the periodic keywords is a periodic givers what you see in the timeline and what are you doing our topics you essentially extracting topics in the conversation?\n",
      "Cause this update this one say topics and maybe put this comment at the other one some a service because that is what method is following and Link both of them this issue that open.\n",
      "Were not going to intersperse the topics with the manual markers that have been created or not.\n",
      "cluster -=======>  1\n",
      "Is there at that field will have to update once we get it?\n",
      "There is also acceptable anymore if you have this.\n",
      "You create a new one will create a whole service Revenue Service.\n",
      "Yes, you can it is make the product magnetic sensor consists for the names of my service itself.\n",
      "So you see you so in this one what spending is discussing of the just solidifying the spec what the what each Lambda would return us ready?\n",
      "So that method can start working on it.\n",
      "it says so these are the input segmented is which have got we are able to see right when that\n",
      "And for all of the groups, I am adding a log saying that no chapter marker for due to a shorter duration of two segments are less than XnumberX seconds.\n",
      "I do not know the meeting duration total duration.\n",
      "So once that is done, let us assume we got all the for each group.\n",
      "Need to filter or reduce any counter.\n",
      "We try to take the larger segment.\n",
      "You larger segment like for Alpha larger segments.\n",
      "Okay, so then we will come to deployment separately less assuming.\n",
      "Let is assume that I am hitting the a Lambda function with all the segments and I am getting a group set set of groupings with each object.\n",
      "Yes, Each of which would contain the segment ID as a field and the text and the sentence.\n",
      "Let is discuss on the community thing, right?\n",
      "Also, that means he pick up the number of pieces you can see.\n",
      "Let me just reiterate what has been mentioned in the\n",
      "Community let us assume it is the same deployment because what you are doing is you are accepting features and you are just using those features and breaking the sentence article with somebody right to deserve.\n",
      "So in this one so but is it up can this what are you doing right now can be taken it to use for anything else that it requires it to be a separate Lambda like it is in the group in perspective.\n",
      "But before that in during the call, we need to be able to send all the segments that were created to a different Lambda right instead of the current one.\n",
      "We need to know the segment ready for.\n",
      "Under the we like we need to purchase those sentences for one segment.\n",
      "With respect to the first one the second the API.\n",
      "Now the new summary it is there that highlights right highlights means what are the different distinct set of items being discussed in the past and they will be merging with the manual markers that we create.\n",
      "We Implement in your analyzer right B it information and return.\n",
      "Okay, so and it will also add a new field called feel call or text in each object.\n",
      "We evident even definitely girl second analyzed.\n",
      "Replace the film service during the live call in.\n",
      "All it does is like it analyzes the segment each segment separately stores if each other Vector area so setting\n",
      "I am saying one is doing feature extraction one is we during the call are doing protects preprocessing on each segment and doing feature extraction and returning okay of error.\n",
      "Yeah, that would be grouped as a single segment only we want again spread that.\n",
      "What all the architects in the so how do you want us to send the so basically will it be take all the segments of for each group send it in one shot to keep his Senate has one request to keep your service.\n",
      "Yes generation field called Dont extract do not populate the graph.\n",
      "We make any concurrent calls to get the key phases for each group.\n",
      "That means they cannot be reused for the second one.\n",
      "Come back to school we call this analyzer and staging we just created as a subject in the current table as it is and they hate us and the actual NLP readers empty.\n",
      "So whenever I am in a segment analyzed we just use it to detect some very positive process somebody at this point once all the parrot is extracted.\n",
      "Whatd you do is XnumberX gather all the segments in The Firm sort them any ascending order if it is not already and call the canoe Lambeth.\n",
      "Improving service array basically if you are giving a segments, yeah, you can see that there are some between this time range.\n",
      "It should prefer that to this one.\n",
      "But still if you give them overlapping watch links for the same portion of the call, is it helpful because manual Motors are more descriptive at least makes more sense to the human eye.\n",
      "Actually, he is saying that will send this will return the same object like you turn for each group will have a list of segment objects and the form and the structure is same as what you send us requests hole with an additional field called Alta text.\n",
      "If you had limit on five you want to cover the whole years is at least as a big thing.\n",
      "Stayed out and seeding will only enable strategy for space.\n",
      "So let us put a full limit me on this.\n",
      "Slipping so do you are or would it be easier?\n",
      "So what if the format is just a group list of segments and the associated alter text.\n",
      "It is clear, but you can put it in the other you have another issue right in the APA GitHub itself.\n",
      "Actually, there is no power from two or three hours.\n",
      "Is that whether it is five or six or seven?\n",
      "I say so even even now that still remain so what are we return you will show everything or if you do not want it to be clever put an upper limit put a upper limit to better manage the space.\n",
      "Ideally table of contents can only be found in the book is complete.\n",
      "So what do I give as part of periodic chapters that every five segments is just a set of keywords the deducted for those primary part.\n",
      "Maybe if you want to also use group segments as chapters like in like so then you will be chopped what it I did it as a surprise to cover the whole range of discussions like separated segregate all the different different topics.\n",
      "But your again separating it into two groups right now.\n",
      "You can be seen before member this becomes different.\n",
      "So even if we let us assume the vision the summary the baby thought when everything in slack not even doing anything, so no, it will not let us see what happens, right?\n",
      "So initially, what we will do in staging we will not be markers in the new summary the way we push things somebody.\n",
      "So this strategy whatever we working on right now, the grouping strategies warning only going to apply and staging and production.\n",
      "So even for now just so that we can observe what is coming out from the grouping and what we expect in the keywords.\n",
      "Deployment package ready, but ask the shun to change the because you have to change the way except response rate coming included on the response of is working on that once it is there L Death.\n",
      "We can merge and remove any choppers that go inside.\n",
      "cluster -=======>  2\n",
      "No, not not that big a dick.\n",
      "If it is XnumberX seconds, if you want to remove the condition make it make it less than threshold for now.\n",
      "XnumberX minutes and then there are there are enough.\n",
      "And we have to have something else.\n",
      "We do the same for actions as well.\n",
      "Maybe XnumberX seconds or something as a placeholder.\n",
      "So inside or today is call it happen.\n",
      "If you see the screen, right, I have one log.\n",
      "Just so that we are on the same page because this is a replacement chapter.\n",
      "This is doing is just what happened and get it for you did not see that the mostly less than XnumberX seconds with them.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, we can remove the catheter and I will filter that try say in some sort of like XnumberX seconds is a hard limit.\n",
      "Going to call and well and the second number is no number service.\n",
      "Okay, its production rate so it is not even updated.\n",
      "Yeah, I have to like like four to five watches.\n",
      "Let is say in group XnumberX it is an array of Group XnumberX is an array of objects embolism, right?\n",
      "So so I had looked at that tart that flowchart Witcher XnumberX had sent rate on the earlier.\n",
      "But with respect to the API a signature ways.\n",
      "I wanted to discuss like what are the request response those things basically?\n",
      "I think if it goes with I think the same logic that is going to intense actress currently a which session is a concept called here.\n",
      "It would be the same like whatever you give for scorer service, right?\n",
      "Okay, so we switch it up and we give like you give each segment as an input and then you receive a distance go, right?\n",
      "So just so that we are all on the same page.\n",
      "So right now what happens is at the end of the call when we decide to say that hairball is ended in a ready to push the summary.\n",
      "Okay, okay, he will not be expecting any scores.\n",
      "What is the request is nothing right only the instance ID unit meeting insensitive or whatever.\n",
      "Find anything so we can do it.\n",
      "Yeah, so that is also Lambda is\n",
      "For example, let us say when I call this new servers on let us do this.\n",
      "Okay Android if nothing is written in their objective some preprocessing error.\n",
      "There is something really yeah if they return okay, we need to not relate to it analysis analysis object right at least and say if you look at the way current code\n",
      "Do what you want to use then give it?\n",
      "You sent a request with the same request you present for new service.\n",
      "Yes at the end of the curve you getting all the segments and you are doing some more stuff and trying to get break them down into individual sentences and give us grouping based on those segments sentences and to the segment is to which they belong right?\n",
      "It would be like a completely separate So currently we have this core is always right and grouping sequence of us right now.\n",
      "It is this right the rapper service or on both of them.\n",
      "Let is say XnumberX is minus XnumberX are some negative value meaning that they are not even anything correctly.\n",
      "We will trigger somebody header like with the new strategy.\n",
      "Okay, you just by looking at them even slap.\n",
      "If you want me to give I can give it your all.\n",
      "Yeah, like so you have some XnumberX groups if you have done right do we?\n",
      "You create another show post with them.\n",
      "That is so yeah, you do not have to do in the pool right now.\n",
      "Yeah, everybody will just push further they give us right now and staging to see if it is good enough right and later.\n",
      "Okay, let us do overlap macon is do we remove this or do we keep this or what makes sense?\n",
      "Karthik event got the laptop chargers down.\n",
      "I think I am trying to connect some iOS but it is fairly.\n",
      "Maybe not immediately, but that is if you go to production that might be needed.\n",
      "But just you have to keep that in mind.\n",
      "Maybe not caught not listen call them chapters.\n",
      "Security my whole idea was like been in future.\n",
      "But that your engine anything right now, right?\n",
      "If you to make real time, it would still more or less work in the way you currently intended.\n",
      "So we had to make it real time.\n",
      "Hmm that very comfortable that this is working as intended.\n",
      "That is yeah, but we try to call fate action items with groups.\n",
      "I mean I have I have them.\n",
      "within the time Ridge so okay, please find anything is okay for actions now just only top\n",
      "Yeah, I have a placeholder need to work on it for now.\n",
      "I am just setting that empty basically empty.\n",
      "cluster -=======>  3\n",
      "We do not have anything to do with the only thing somebody.\n",
      "So we will have to have like a pipeline for that like in each section that we publish.\n",
      "Yeah, let us let us discuss this in the next.\n",
      "But we need to know the mapping for that.\n",
      "That is the that is what we discussed earlier also.\n",
      "But the problem here is we should not be working.\n",
      "Actually, there is some more work here with it because they are actually returning some data and the original one the second one.\n",
      "I am carrying all that information at that point.\n",
      "But the mile marker does not contain those things.\n",
      "We thought we will stick to five for now and then do that but that is not really that does not stop anything.\n",
      "So let us separate that and I like that idea from this video.\n",
      "And then we really wanted confident of this is working as expected.\n",
      "cluster -=======>  4\n",
      "Yeah, the group segmented is her like mostly like to two segments are grouped.\n",
      "What does it on all let me see eight minutes.\n",
      "And you want us to make basically they were in groups.\n",
      "So are they very tightly coupled with each other.\n",
      "No, there is no we yeah, I mean the whole even if you were to replace whatever we have right now for now assume they are two different age is one is just by minute highlights fiveminute keywords essential keywords within a specific time period they do not all of it.\n",

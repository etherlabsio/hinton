It's bad. So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it's more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what's the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him. So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I'll work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I don't know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that's how you make the schedule it's like and then you think well if I have that day that I'd be good great you know and you're useless and so you're probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you'd like to have.\",\n",

I would say that the pay is with your experience are selling like job application but if you're new to the whole thing you might be able to get an internal and that maybe like junior designer position and then move your way up and with different experiences kind of get yourself working in the industry if you're transition over from like web design or even more traditional print or design you might want to take a few courses and do a little bit of up studying on the best practices of user interface design and spend some time owning that crap because it is very very different.

I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there's a bit responsibility that's going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you're going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you're not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that's a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it's like sorry, that's just not a good strategy. It's bad. So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it's more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what's the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him. So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I'll work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I don't know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you're negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that's how you make the schedule it's like and then you think well if I have that day that I'd be good great you know and you're useless and so you're probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you're going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you'd like to have. \n",

This is just one type of configuration option for dot Corp in fact, it's not the configuration option.

There's a stack of different options for example, Azure which even as they're very to and stored and encrypted your most sensitive animation and then can point in just like you was hearing or not selling that Json in fact it will look at multiple locations and based on your priority will select those highest one that finds so how you are absent such chase on your local development but then have your Azure override that in production even or staging.

Alright chris so let's give an call this person we want hear one three. Now depends on your time and your experience your location. So maybe do a little bit of research on that because I just cannot give you the best answer for now for you specifically okay. So now we're to talk about users interface design what one are the responsibilities of UI designer how do you learn it. It's a good career all those kind things we're have tough out right now we're user experience design us all about user experiencing the product and having a label interaction with it user interface design is visual cousin on speak it's all a look feel and the interaction and the presentation of the product itself. It's something might be saying doesn't that help me have a better user experience yes, it does that's why there's across from Gray, but Ui is more closely related to the visual communication arts like graphic design has been picking colors and or you making things really be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at for u UI the responsibilities that you'll find there are more related to design to web design to maybe even branding sign and also time front and development because having a good understanding of code design. Okay nowadays all on there is such a thing as face designer for things like copies side of Airplane and you know all that kind of stuff but as closely is know used in under the stuff now like websites and products, but you is to receive. \n",

Let me make this even simpler a uX designer is going pa*s on skeleton and the UI designer is going to put on the scan closed and direct that knife people responsibility does use entire and the biggest sprint is the look and feel of the product the UI designer will do a good compet*tive a**lysis of what's going on in that same market what's like the standard what's a good look and field join a design research to make sure that the product makes sense like the designer isn't a children application of making a look like a for walk, then designer just gonna to do all of the graph additional design for project. If they interface for like an application or website. We're talking colored or fee. We're talking b**tons and interactions with all that kind of visual stuff nowadays standard for you runners to also be thinking about animation interactions to the a UI designer also their design in every screen site our illusion. So whether there websites being viewed on a desktop for mobile device or maybe an cost three have to look good in all of those different aspects and then also the designer you is responsible for interacting was developer and making sure that things look and feel and all work the way that they should this report to development and the UX and the UI team all kind of come together and they making sure everything that is supposed to be every step way a UI designer. It's not necessarily a branding designer. Although they are closely tied to the brand of a company of product and they need to implement that brand through the design of the. \n",

So how do you learn you either design and is a good paying job and where get jobs that similar to us design. There's probably some great boot camps in your area. If you're near a large city if you're not in your large city that there's plenty resources online. I would think even more resources to learn I design design and visual design. Then there actually is for something such user experience fine. So I would look at find those resources that I'll link a bunch of like favor resources down the description. So you guys can find those and use those what about getting a job in the space of the UI designer can you do something like that absolutely log them great jobs especially in the tech industry for great user interface designer. I would say that the pay is with your experience are selling like job application but if you're new to the whole thing you might be able to get an internal and that maybe like junior designer position and then move your way up and with different experiences kind of get yourself working in the industry if you're transition over from like web design or even more traditional print or design you might want to take a few courses and do a little bit of up studying on the best practices of user interface design and spend some time owning that crap because it is very very different. Although we use a below of those basics client principles which I just love and think are just the investing in so as long important basic design principles. You can kind of transition them over to you either. So there is the difference thing between you and UX design some overlap a little bit of similarities, but very very different.

Let's understand what is DNs get simple words data can be fans related to any object in consideration for example, your name page et cetera are some data related to you and picture image file PDF et cetera can all be considered data. Now what is a database we already know what data is, but this day that could be random a database is a collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy. What is a database management system database management system or is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access the database up data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people own numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a gave to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data cetera. Let's consider the Facebook. It needs to store everything and present data related to members their friends member activities messages advertis***nts and a lot more.

This type of is rarely used nowadays is structure is like a with notes representing records and branches represented. The the windows registry used in IP is an example of a hierarchical hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with notes network. This type of supports many to many relationships. This usually result in complex database structures our server is an example of a database management system that implement the network model relational and this type of defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations. Unlike the network D M s our d m does now support many to many relationships relational usually have pre data that they can support. This is the most popular type in the market examples of relational database management systems include and Microsoft server object oriented relational t m. This type support story of new types that data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored the database have actually for example generate or age and methods that find what to do with the data gray you is an example of object oriented relational.

They research that wire user tests the list goes on and off if you're new to the game this can all feel very overwhelming well throw that here out the window because we're about to embark on a journey through the sixteenth end of the UX design process that before starting any successful uX project you'll need to be in tune with two things your user in your brain. I start with the user big question around this is what problems are they making once you can identify the problem, then you can begin to start working to towards the solution second is understanding the brain and how does the project you're are working on aligned with the branch mission and goal to summarize in this stage you wanna identify the problems facing the users as well as the core goals of the brand and see how they along as a designer you probably have a gun of a*sumptions about what the user wants or doesn't want but not challenging those a*sumptions channel. If you want to hold that's two people dig yourself out on one on one interviews focus groups surveys and usability ask few methods to how bet your a*sumptions base them on real tangible evidence and keep mind you don't need a survey a million users a good rule of thumb is finding three to five users in your target audience they'll save you time and typically give you as much data as you need to move forward with your project. Now that you've done your research you can take all our data and start working with it one way to lay out your research visually as with a user persona. So as will act as a guy when it comes to making all of your design to say if you ever get stuck you can always look back to the Brazil to figure out the users need and if you need a wider view of the big picture journey that your users take try a user journey app creating a user journey map can help you understand what the users will be going through when they interact with your product or. Service this can give great insight on pain points and how to restructure them before moving into the next stage in this stage you'll actually build out the design you'll create things like site user flows mock ups and other officials. One the most valuable things you can create this stage is a wire a wire is a low fidelity representation of your product some designers even use in as prototype you most likely call land on your ideal product after one buyer sketch. So grab sketchbook a pencil a large couple coffee because it's gonna to be a long way in the end the wire friends should do maybe the overall direction and description of the user interface. So after designing designing and then design some more you'll start collaborating with your development team to turn your carefully crafted designs into a real working product all while keeping a good cadence of check and feedback along the way because lets is really everyone's job it only gets better with collaboration. Once the product launches. It's time for another round of a**lysis, but this time you wanna to ask yourself in your team questions like where did our process go right where did we struggle how are losers responding to the product. Then we solve their issues and angles with a solid amount of reflection you'll gain in valuable knowledge that you can leverage to make sure future projects run even more stable and that brings us to the end of our journey. Now you have an idea of what it takes for the UX designer and hopefully feel a little bit more comfortable and jumping into a new UX position but keep in mind that every Ux design process is going to be unique to your business and product c's. API stands for application programming interface and basically it's something that allows one piece.To software to talk to another and there's lots of different kinds of apis. But when you hear people talk about Twitter's API or Google's API, but they're talking about is a rest API the rest API stands for representational State transfer now, it doesn't have to be the case. But usually a rest API works pretty much the same way a website. Does you make a call from a client to a server and you get data back over the HTTP protocol? I think one of the best ways to show the many similarities between the rest API call and loading it on the web page can be found with Facebook's graph API. For example, let's pull up YouTube space be WWF facebook.com slash YouTube. We're all familiar with what a Facebook page looks like shows how many likes the YouTube page has things like that. But now let's change the www depart to graph got facebook.com slash YouTube and what we get back is a response to our API requests. We've made an API request in our browser to Facebook Graph API.But we get back might appear to be gibberish to the human eye, but it's actually JavaScript object notation or Json formatted data. It's structured data organized. According to key value pairs same way an Excel spreadsheet is structured key value pairs in my task for the data that's in sell a 16. You can ask a Json array for the data if you want to know how many likes as Facebook page had for the data contained Under The Chi-Lites.And all modern programming languages will be able to interpret. I Wanna introduce with the idea of parameters, but we love that same Facebook a P I request but the time looks at guilt equal I D maine and like now will we refresh the page you see that only ID D name likes to be that's because these parameters have filtered through the data that we get out of this response. I'll take a look at another API example one that I think it's really cool provided about Google maps and allows you to take a city name or even an address and turn it into a safe G k quarter at dot com slash maps slash a P i slash e O codes slash case. Remember what we just talked about. The server that we're calling is Maps out Google apis that calm and then the particular resource. We've drilled down its the maps resource and then the API resource and then the geocode resource and we've even added Jason as a resource and that's because the Google Maps API can return data in a number of different products. Planners like address equal Chicago and Sensory stuff and as you can see we got another Json in response and if we look in Json a and we go to the key results and then the key geometry and then the key location we receive a att*tude and Longitude coordinates for the Chicago. Now that's great all your difference location components probably that the we do with them well let's smash two eight seller kick your importance over the instagram and plug them into Instagram media search. So order gonna to access the Instagram media searching points about having to write code. We're gonna to add over to dot com like developers left insights with a API com and we'll be able to use this API possible that's provided by a in order to make the request to the instagram Guy without receiving writing code and you can see it click on the drop down the left. There's a whole bunch of Apis i's that the set up that place but an our getting instagram. We're gonna using the Instagram media search input which you can see as that a I dot instagram dot com slash version in one we one slash media plus search and we're gonna set the following parameters and you can see that are added to our URL R request three. We're at that last equal of forty. One twenty eight seven launched two to negative eight eighty seven point six two and we'll set our distance of twenty minutes. We cents and we get back into information about our request because you can be able request and it shows where we spends to web minor we've pa*sed him one of the frame that we didn't sit with the accident token because that was automatically set by the interface and then below that in of the blue you have two value pairs of headers that sense as part of our request and then be look over at the response you can see we got an HTTP t status code to two hundred which may in success that ahead and then there's some another of information as well, we've got x ray limit limit which is five thousand which is the total number of requests you can make three and API you want access token during one. Material and then Demo Agency actually meeting which is forty thousand nine ninety four which is how many requests we have remaining in this statement and then they're writing about cookies and the content type application Json things like that know we told that we'll see the value of this month which is a Json right of all the images that match the view codes that we pa*sed and there's operations information such changed as a filter with you, you know to take the picture you like review comments information without user posted it how many followers. They have things like that and then of course there's also be made itself and if we copy you that image can pick it up and are you all rather would pay for today then you can see there's a picture from that location copy even August the background people right. There's literally thousands of APis p out there that you can tap and take their data match it up pa*s to another API guy cause whatever web website you some kind of API that you use you already consume their data these guys they're available get out program programmable that dot com and so now we've only been consuming data from APis p. So you can also write data page. So we probably go down that road, but he's talking a little bit about the concept that each p with best methods the one doc*mentation and description flow but think tune that you really need to know our GIT and post now a give a cla*s and what you tune data in message see do so far by pa*sing these urL parameters in order to get data back from they've guy but a post request for writing data to the API in the best practices is to actually put the data into audio of the information. Now doesn't allow you to put data in the audio of or request boot days against.\n",

      " I was in the main you were called two functions one and two the main function is stored in a file a one. Hi hey video about thirty much better Java merchant machine. So the some my this topic for the video. So because they happens to even of the payment topics going to U S I then it's something to so you. There's a employee room might be decrease with a lot of questions regarding give you my last moving and then it's there alias joined and check. So let's see what they that. So the the main function of is load and execute your application new application generally is the platform dot flash. So how do you agree your dot pa*s by maybe only first enter your application file which twenty example, problem my add time Java. So it is that my app the file. Then you find that my so you have in day of complaining. I account cla*s. So you might to Java command and by thinking this skip me call Java right app from Java and then they say you get my a*s dot pa*sword by and this is the gla*s line that you would want to execute so you call tell my app so at the time when you call to command me Julian instance. Let's see how does change instance load and execute your cla*s back. You can see that there's is a loading component and there's an execution component and as respect is this probably the cross order and this is called the execution feature. The is responsible Learning applications plus five. So in that spring example, research might app. So in this case, the cla*s order is just responsible for loading my app dot last and it also has to load the big and cla*s files startup part of Canadian. So we gla*s files for example, if we have string cla*s our cla*s and we all the connection gadgets have to drive and then we don't cla*ses that be between by own instructions. I heading to the notification engine and the execute end in is was responsible for executing the white. So you know basically white code the execution engine has shipped up to equal operating system, you know to execute the instructions finally again, the instruction set. So for that the execution engine makes new meeting with the calls and finally, you know it gets transferred the machine by by the response of any on the operations. So now let's go for we pick because you know mean s cloud uploading graphs the cloud by code or the data will be loaded to something load a memory and so in action city market based on more component, but which is the data areas or memory areas. Yes. So then they can get that back or we have weekly three component breakdown of premium market architecture but here you have the first component which is the cla*s the source. So in then time yes, there the application into these are three main components of premium marker.\n",

      " That detailed a little white. So let's zoom into the cla*sroom how that works so the cloud for the system has the main status load link and machines. So load is the part that responsible of uploading the white code the memory loading can load we thought plus by from various sources generally when you call Java my app and in the previous example, my app would be in the dot cla*s platform. So the club made it from the pipe the cla*sroom may from a job file which can contains dot pa*sword and it can even wait from video sources like a network socket. Like I've been watching my channel you know that in the earlier video I showed you how to use cla*sic search on instance, but the problem with that setup of is that. Everybody, this is Cherie. Millie from dots way does calm and today. I'm going to talk about AWS elastic search. We're going to talk about what is it exactly how to create it and how to use it. Now first. What is elasticsearch elasticsearch is a free open source engine, which is used for analytic purposes and for searching you logs or the data in general.And talking about AWS elastic search. It's just like Amazon. They have moved it. They made it easier for you as a service to create it in the clouds. You can use it for several reasons not only the online for checking your logs or data book. We can connect it to your to your cloud and use combine. After containing the W S Elastic search you can have several ways to add there or connect with to lot we can use it by a T i and send files or data and we can connect choosing any of your codes to do it automatically also you can even use look with the last dash with the cloud arch also you can connect the with the cloud watch and directly can have streaming over the logs. You can use a lot of third parts plugins with depth aWs elastic search like for have used once Amazon s three revenue plugin which that connect the S three to the N W elastic search with the basic commands to like grow we can add a lot of indexes modify and delete it. Start and key the Elastic Search Service just log to your AWS console and search here for elastic search. Opening the Elastic Search. We gonna have the option to create a new name. But then main name that you want them. Let's call for example last way to. Is gonna ask you for the version that you wanna to I'm running and check and use the latest and again since it's the service based on asking search. It's giving you the option to choose what person you want. Gonna have the optional number of instances that you want to use based on the performance. The loans and the number of files that you're gonna have since it's a testing tutorial I'm going one and from the side like any of the other services Amazon. We can check what type with hardware configuration that you want. I glad choose a small one. You need some significant markers notes to handle your logs and your files, but since it again tutorial. I'm not gonna check it there's one awareness. It's something similar to the multi with the which thankfully it means like it's gonna have a copy of your your AWS elastic search in different data centers along the region that you've used it. This is the topic of the storage that you want to use either it's going to be rules and the or an ABS for the emails from volume time we can choose either the handle purpose wise for again if you have the load then you are concerned about the performance. We can use the professional i. Number of the the volume size is going be done for each and so if you have two here and we have and guys then it's gonna be quite. Related snapshots so it's gonna affect the performance somehow it's not gonna need for downtime, but it's there pictures choose the time that you know that there are no customers or you are not using it. We need to attach the policy to that Elastic search for that policy this one which was going to show which users and what textbooks instances can connect to the elastic search for now I'm gonna use something that is open to all the domain from any I p, which is not for sure command for production. It's gonna apply the Json policy which she can Edit later. So that is sounds user if you to promote the information that I've got and he just created it. Can it speaks about from a to maybe fifteen minutes maximum and for the purpose of the tutorial of created one another one earlier that we can use it after for time for screen minutes. You're gonna have that green text reading active and they're you're gonna have the end endpoint which you're gonna use all the time to connect to add text mixes notify them correct.\n",

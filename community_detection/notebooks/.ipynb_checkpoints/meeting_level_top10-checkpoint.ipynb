      "I think this is extended it is weird case that is okay I am am just trying to think of corner cases what happens if there is what happens is if there is a like a twenty minute possible that file after the call after after two the end of the call and then everyone everyone just hung up.\n",
      "That is that is what we so you check there is it if it is not available you you the features okay just in case if it if it has missed because of any of this calls start yeah, I yeah, or do you think that is of facing this problem to some extent.\n",
      "That is also like like Karthik call that you mentioned where you were on call for two to hours there is a file more than like twenty minutes what happens.\n",
      "It is wordpress video so the currently is yeah, that is the prototype the correct one as well because this D seems to just segregated but we just you would want to do that after you gather the context from a medium data.\n",
      "Your condition right as soon as the meeting gets started there is always a transcript that there is a very response segment when that can come within the next two seconds and you do not have Lambda is not in that a bad way of doing the.\n",
      "Yeah that is I saying that is I use universal symptoms code we are label and data that means if you guys then if we have to put the complete flow in perspective we have an article with five five paragraphs.\n",
      "Okay But then but so you saying if we have some three what happens so so for every new meeting starter you are are actually you found working and at Lambda again, that is a problem right.\n",
      "So this this goes and checks that these segment ideas are not part of the graph and then it will start feature extracting and putting everything into graph and then giving the key phrases so that whole time sometimes crosses ten seconds.\n",
      "So it is just downloading the graph file and the clearing for the feature that top five results and then the transcription would still be so it transcription still happens.\n",
      "So that will so that this will basically can help us do like a small p o where we can see if right i just use it for key service with like okay will send me feature records for segment and key phrases and this comments all will read will basically get that request and load graph and populate and do all those things.\n",
      "In mobile I just thought if I have some set of that I can just and them with current media text and then put it into s three with the feature at us and then download it at the end of the meeting just compare it with the groups and then send it okay.\n",
      "But the thing is I like before deploying the production also once tested with four or five long that and but it never gave that call so okay that it current is so yesterday yesterday.\n",
      "Friday was I just extracted all the dads from the medium articles and then just comparison by club all these segments in group content is comparing it will do what three process tax for that particular group.\n",
      "So on so the reason why this Google comparison the respect to tags was just to check whether the onboarding space is actually that will like if we get some I people from all the medium data we have and their tags.\n",
      "So we can perhaps server paragraph for a sentence attach to tag and then compare with the sentences feature vector that would make more sense and even GDP can be used that way instead of taken the tag feature vector cause models are indicated as well.\n",
      "I did for all the books and Okay went up four reports which is what was recommend it and I has get all of the models and I saw that as you train more it got order.\n",
      "The Transcription trigger only have the end of the call correct correct so it will will add up to one more one more one more unit time or lambda tomorrow just trying to understand it.\n",
      "That is so you wondering what the properties of the date does it not exactly the context in sense that is.\n",
      "I do not Dunno if if it is is what is the ether effect of that does that as again.\n",
      "Yeah so we just increase the a time of seconds so forty seconds the only once in a meeting we would actually reach that point that the service and is in course start.\n",

      "And that could be that should be, but you do not aggregate there you will just take the last token feature director okay.\n",
      "Yeah we can go ahead for a fight you task this but to use it in like production I do not think so cause by majority of the of software are a lot of vehicle tags.\n",
      "From the so so ideally the process supposed to be that when I get meeting started so that time I do not get any request to anything.\n",
      "So I use making them wait a queue would be in our head of and then if there but by so it is it is so I think need.\n",
      "But this came all service right the GPU is not and not at as good as sentence code for the key phase to parallel comparison.\n",
      "Let is do I think the reason is getting good to us on U s because of the application over all the two kids.\n",
      "It should not be that much of an issue not I am am missing out some other thing each other which is like an important thing which we need to consider but it seems as you do that.\n",
      "Have a response spend well so you are not the problem is it because you have five minutes of time to do everything and then it could spill our only at times.\n",
      "Then then fine it will will wait we need not GPU or or our we just try tuning on the same approach.\n",
      "We talk to that could that would actually make your data a little more and then and then conversions would be slow, but still you you your model be like.\n",
      "So till this service is doing like it is trying like first time second time or time till then they already send segments.\n",
      "No that is not if that is fine then if you get two segments like from different meetings.\n",
      "Somehow I think we have got with because I could even compare it with the was really bad like unbearable to good.\n",
      "So I was able to run these steps and I could figure out even as the paper they mentioned that the feature space club together because of the training and initial for steps and I against the features piece.\n",
      "So this ad segment if they come immediately and if we are we still not connected to Lambda then basically it is all non processed.\n",
      "Then it is good otherwise software instance started this send ad segments.\n",
      "How is that taking how is the order taken care because you get exactly place for the pins only after the transcription is completed and then you got the request of feature.\n",
      "A kind of handles, but it also creates problem because okay right say suppose for first time we spoke a lot and we for the fifth chapter.\n",
      "If it is not really if there an silence at the end of the call we just need to the the things would be delayed that is it.\n",
      "So the idea is like anyway right now I am using this for population index so later like.\n",
      "So it has to let go through every segment to get key phases and you if if some of these segments are not priced then it has to get director and as.\n",
      "Yeah so we managed to fix it fix it in the sense basically required higher ram memory because it will that tool internally uses elastic search and like some other database or something the index the graph data.\n",

      "I would alright what is the of steps same.\n",
      "And we should try the as well.\n",
      "Yeah okay so in theory you are saying that I mean if you go by the flow we can still for to miss out on the first initial ones we will be do we still be context deadly next only go to work three seconds.\n",
      "And so we for perhaps for I look at other file corresponding and model once we have updated.\n",
      "Know like the if you think there are no practical cases that we index with I think they should be signed by.\n",
      "More context Japanese Slack conversation thing that I said you where we can take yeah so we can add those site that spells along with we data so it can be fine due on that as well along with our previous centric vendors.\n",
      "So so I need to yeah but I call under so that it know avoid the call start.\n",
      "But we hard to include that so like that go.\n",
      "I the Lambda l so do you do you send all if play to single lambda you you do one a time.\n",
      "I think we should access we should accommodate the call started of doing the way we currently do so.\n",
      "Yeah yeah I do think so yeah, because that will help us our one application steps really to better is.\n",
      "So if so data data is in our time so we can always drop that if we take that coming keep.\n",
      "Like of list size of twenty twenty five I was seen it due results in like zero point three seconds maximum more really yeah.\n",
      "So even it never gave me a single set of tax respect to the so it was very very on ninety.\n",
      "As in for, but we are aggregate total level and whereas as for P aggregate is the last sentence for so.\n",

      "This cause all we need to do straight for one on this data etcetera that seems to help.\n",
      "That is actually separating the problem of call start right it is not increasingly think it is it is actually handling.\n",
      "Because that is super but there no or yeah active Lambda.\n",
      "I just still software engineering regardless of whether you filtered around the top tags lot i wait to see.\n",
      "So it was around twenty groups or not even one which had around only four two five sentences instances what.\n",
      "Youre saying something I just saw that.\n",
      "We can just keep Lambda on time seconds plus seconds which we are working.\n",
      "That was code thing is I was able to think.\n",

      "Recording when we are combining them you come ill literally when the text then.\n",
      "That is that is too much first the way we are arguing things like.\n",
      "So if we are going with this approach and it is okay for us spring to the all then an in depth that is more than this basic generates of living done.\n",
      "You can even you can actually even more label one you can map each paragraph.\n",

      "If you get multiple small segments before time Lambda would be more and then the second segment when it comes in the first number is still add so it group write info at new numbers always now yeah.\n",
      "If is like of zero to five we get like twenty segments, but say first the seven of them did not get then basically what happens is before even giving key phrases as I need to call it under the for each to seven of them.\n",
      "Yeah that is decent enough and more when you see things like Doc and kubernetes you see around zero point six point seven and between the is are around point.\n",
      "That is that is highly possible actually so if we have two before meetings you just have have got the created meeting to your service and then you just one and then suddenly you get a second meeting before ground already in book.\n",
      "Know they should not be again for last step but also zoom that you already got those segments before so you got those segments before then you.\n",
      "Yeah and even U S. It just does naive lead application so that could also help us that I mean we see how there else third idea okay yeah all the way is basically.\n",
      "If there is already one run you then yeah, if I call again, the lambda then basically to start a new lambda.\n",
      "So right now I have our onboarding tool that which are separate like in the and around the seven and hundred and ninety tags which to video.\n",
      "Okay So yeah, but let us up for the five clases how that how that so it is still we five clases you still store.\n",
      "I do not know, but but but at least for I think I still can come in but at least for the day paragraph with this he s paragraph versus a key if not as good as sentence and code and it is actually comparable.\n",
      "So it or we can also test it like like multiple calls per everything just to me.\n",
      "Let is say blockchain you yeah, like the tags of engineering the latest shows the most number of times to be this.\n",
      "So so if we start a new call now and and then and then try to intention list stop or some three of those if you create this conflict.\n",
      "So set lambda there to be environment and active every time you get the request but one.\n",
      "Maybe these are all clear theoretical other observation that we made and then and then once we see that happening.\n",
      "They get this and almost like fifteen to twenty nine one.\n",
      "Yeah have they are trying to learn on that or which the label data that good come from the two centers some quarters.\n",
      "From my side, I am just looking into few actually get some kind of task of topics for these group segments if you have.\n",
      "Yeah so that is it line with the paper as well so yeah got.\n",
      "Even if we increase into one minute this would happen only like one and sixteen times right yeah, so yeah, still getting the but but Monday.\n",
      "It is not a clas such it is the golden and score from one to five that.\n",
      "I think what is the base do you compare it with university and.\n",
      "So first i mean did you get to what happened to that visualization thing worked.\n",
      "If I start calling Lambda and I get first segment then the cold started itself takes like forty five seconds.\n",
      "Or sorry got it how much current ten and then if you have any basis at least at least a of time plus something so he.\n",
      "Yeah usually at the the the event call life is right the latest the latest being the pm.\n",
      "So we need to sure that couple application does it that.\n",
      "The same thing you can do it on so yeah that should be possible.\n",
      "--------------cluster 3------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "Okay So also Karthik by telling that get so if was the problem is it is it something that you can put it in some two line trillions for us to understand that.\n",
      "Yeah, but do not you think that should be for the for the processing of of this kind of like call it arrays condition or not but you have a here right.\n",
      "So yeah issue i. I think difficult go by if you go by the way your training couple obligations should not have any should have should not have any any negative impact feature.\n",
      "I just told him that we should if if we taking time to conclude this we should that only have all the models in staging two.\n",
      "We not avoid it and mean what can we do with those kind of situation and that is why should should we should accept calls set as part of our so let us means instead of trying to.\n",
      "I mean yeah I do not know whether this the case but these are two cases that I do not know whether we should handle it or whether we can find a worker on for this.\n",
      "I think that we should all I think we should also have translate this all this scenarios.\n",
      "So if the universal sentence and encoder for a word like go will give you the same feature vector for no matter what it is whether it is the board game go the language code to go.\n",
      "So if you appearing you can to text streams and this one how how did you compute that only one network enough for this.\n",
      "So we have like a around fourteen fourteen thousand of fifteen thousand which is impossible to compute clarity that is why we are talking.\n",
      "Yeah, that is also so I do not know what to we unless we have an idea i think pretty but the transfer topics when Karthik was mentioning.\n",
      "We and all I am saying is they just learn the context if okay if you say if there is a better way better.\n",
      "Yeah that is true because we are not I that vector application seems to perform any other that people come up with so yeah.\n",
      "About it what takes and then and then if you do not know if you want to replace an P that work.\n",
      "I think we should be able to see that happening in in this meeting.\n",
      "--------------cluster 4------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "Only asociate the one take universal sentence quarter decades paragraph and then Associate only the more similar tag and then use that does not have as a label data that you find you for the for the support path.\n",
      "That that would work one if the true set of clas which we give that is the from the article and the tags.\n",
      "But if we do not know it is I think it is I think it is practically for us to learn the context by by giving the anurag and then this sentence this token.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess we should there is also the point of stability at the paragraph level right.\n",
      "So all if I added but but but if we should be able to accommodate this immediate request without without leaving it right.\n",
      "Yeah yeah, yeah, if giving for paragraph you randomly the label from the from track right.\n",
      "Right the right number the problem is like we do not have any approximation going on.\n",
      "And then the closest thing that we should test on is not on the pseudo.\n",
      "So it is like seven Lambda calls great feature at store in the graph and all those things then query for feature.\n",
      "Okay But if we are taking features of tags is that investor because all of our models are called text based.\n",
      "If the create an exception which does not in includes so.\n",
      "So then I load it into of this and then we can see all the.\n",
      "We should accommodate call start instead of trying to expect some lambda that will be available.\n",
      "Oh that is what it should be if you increase it at least lambda of time plus some not more.\n",
      "Whereas in G. It sort of blue is called text over the tokens and there is only an aggregate context of the and at so perhaps we can try the vector of traction method that I came up with last week.\n",
      "Just that much compliance just take a group which has multiple statements combined them and then take what by.\n",
      "--------------cluster 5------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "Okay Let is same can you have whatever are side from this interesting.\n",

      "--------------cluster 6------------ \n",

This will like be note from the so so it does not show the the entire graphs user least we are going just show whatever you click or whatever you query. So to make it faster it tries to index it and then show us. So for that it required a higher space and so we changed.

If is like of zero to five we get like twenty segments, but say first the seven of them did not get then basically what happens is before even giving key phrases as I need to call it under the for each to seven of them.

There is something that I be very was do not come a framework frameworks like Ruby or something that is too allows some invoices from kind of practices upon the developer and sort of expects the about the right code such that will only work well written in that order and to word away from the same words, you know specific in a workings and things will kind of make you words from the community around view also right. So especially when we work then like one of model and rails backend group on one of the biggest problems are things like handling database connections across different regions. You know using the appropriate data connection database connection or you only your master et cetera and you have to do a lot of to get that in where we go in have had to had chosen the right form of abstraction and design patterns that are put in place and will allow us to easily move with logic or handle much well the second thing was at least some other framework.\"\n",

So most of the experience support were like is just incredibly hard to do reviews developers would constantly argue us, which is the right or the most way to write code and this is focused on those just figure on how what is a good design how the this code scale that and so we sort of makes call know now let us just put that aside look at closure. I ideally like that a lot but again I because it to the list of the foundation of the language is very small. There is not a lot of things that learn about the language to go work. Yeah, but that because also that it is list most people uncomfortable, especially because when we started it. We need people with media processing background. These will go at work especially on lower level systems and plus plus with handling network related itself are heavily comfortable of as a language and to train them do not just learn like how to write high level software was one concern that Wouldve happen regardless of what language. We choose but on top of that piece then my whole different paradigm. I am of writing go reading code would just be another concern at that point right it also had good teams in so also nice and the way the languages was defined and maintained by the core team was very nice open changes they are are now going to do introduce changes are already stable you can use one want which is a big bonus because we get to follow the and also.\"\n",

Okay now dial dealing with how my system interact with other systems in the company and how it performs. What it needs to the status are the business requirements. Now how now is to now let us worry about how systems communicate with each other right. So then transfer put it layer and work. Now in that that you have to worry about okay, how will I transfer information between two services also.\"\n",

Let is say for example and leaving with the so entty call meeting some of the common tasks that would expect to do with the would be to get a meeting by identifier to store the meeting object if I give it and two be able will do query meeting days on certain attributes if I need to which again, those interfaces. Sometimes can be very databases certain databases. Sometimes cannot this important for one to think about can I use a light while you store in general, but sometimes you might have to query by certain with different differently in narrow. You might want to have a initial index which table with an index on which is your one in base systems you can just maybe just create an directly understand table itself but that dollar consider the database how you optimized query inside the database should be separated from your service layer.

So to give an example, list like at least in the ruby, you would have a forward all models right and you put the meeting entty put the transcription entty you put like contextual core object like an entty detail into the same folder essentially and by doing so what is happening is within that photo people do not try to create tight between those entties.

The system generates try to tie different services to get the and tries to hold information and generate new right for the track on and form that kind so they of old okay I need the talk a meeting service creating.\",\n",

I think so there is not a lot of communication request their reply and like use across the board so what we and and that a most scalable of approach is to use and even design pattern for system communication and handling to changes systems. So for that we need none the that all requests reply kind of items right or all that what we need is so we use that which is the system that we use for to support request like also that it the good thing about it is it does support responsive, but more importantly we use it for messages and aiming that is so what we should be doing for all internal communication. We should be using which is more reliable for sending for creating more events and having with and on them. What would be interesting is to create a small server system that would just subscribe all the topics and lax and you create an event log that one can just read from and you will create like it is on use the data for whatever you it needs to do like creating state back in case of.\",\n",

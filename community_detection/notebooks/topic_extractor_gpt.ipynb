      "Is the discussion around Agile has to following different practices using various technologies and even developing with specific tools while these things might help a team is trying to follow agile they are agile in and of themselves for example, while a team may time that having a daily stand meeting is helpful the stand is only agile out to be extent that it is the resolved of a team all into the agile principles and values when you understand this it is easy to see the agile is really a release that teams team use were making decisions about how to do the work developing software.\n",
      "This means the term agile gets subject to a great deal of views with people saying that this for that is way to the agile it also means that you you truly understand what agile is it is surprisingly flexible agile does not make decisions for you instead it gives you foundation that teams can use to make decisions that resolved in better software development.\n",
      "Agile says we are covering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to it through this work we had come to value individuals and interactions over offices in tools working software over comprehensive and docmentation customer collaboration negotiation responding to change over following a planned that is while there is value in the items on the right we value the items on the left more.\n",
      "It is not a framework or process new most of the things they are marketing to agile tend to miss the point of what agile is.\n",
      "Well discuss what agile is not many things be called agile, especially by people who are trying to sell you something if you ask the makers of paper products they will tell you that to the agile you need to write your user stories on the sticky note cart that they just happened to sell.\n",
      "So the more comfortable your shoes more agile your team the actual definition the action is found and the may we a test makes it clear the agile is not a methodology it is not a specific way of doing software develop it.\n",
      "Ask consultant likely here it is a methodology for developing software that your organization can learn if you buy their services and if you talk to the makers of the meeting shoes you will be told that the key being agile is meetings where everyone stands up.\n",
      "The twelve principles are our highest priority is to satisfy the customer to early in continuous delivery valuable software two welcome changing requirements even late to development agile processes harness change with the customers compettive a advantage number three deliver working software frequently for a couple of weeks to a couple of months with for the shorter time scale.\n",
      "I am Mark I help organizations right software more efficiently and often this means helping teams to understand what it means to develop in a natural way in this video we are are going to answer the question what we is agile and just as important.\n",

      "Now we can mind me I will give it as call and then when we are selecting our take long them how already have the android k and installed on my wanna to make sure this is check as well as the intel performance box and since I will be running this on a device full include an android merchant device as well.\n",
      "Loaded all of these steps of Install where studio application folder and then much in since you want have any premium settings you can choose works at things click will be the installation and now I presented with the android studio setup up with on the first screen.\n",
      "What I am going to change personally for the I again, think it is great left side or this solve to left side we want to during well just wait second background instance like I said red still and a lot of contractors you change it up just so that you can create a separation between this this market.\n",
      "I am between showing the design just the blue both when you this btons up here so just to make things it is a little easier to see when the spring I will be using the design here but keep in mind if you want to see the blue bit view it is always there now to make our bton say we just need to update the text over here right.\n",
      "Lanka so brand tutorial here today this be tutorial and lot of of nasty I think it is either absolutely it is today is topic is going to me by thinking ninety videos user or interface or a website for crashing like domain experience design or whatever of how do take any time and no help probably what need CSS structure and so usually on my and I am either are covering one aspect just like or just one aspect of me else so I thought I would do too more to videos to between today tomorrow or today I am just going to show you how change the sign right here and think about you design what of about website.\n",
      "Were we look get a few definition we never we are going to look at several examples mean I think then you are going to see I am confidence you are going to have a solid idea solve understanding what they actually we be typed is coming up in the video a few days next week I am going to show you also how to build meaning create and for you to understand what it is make sure you watches this first right so for today is did I do a good job explaining out.\n",
      "So really as long as you are not publishing the app to the place this can be whatever you want lastly and used to be fairly in Java, but recently we getting the freedom to use which I think this a ticket job.\n",
      "Let is start by downloading android studio like the link below we go to the end developer website and collect the download.\n",
      "Let is think started me android studio project to get started first will we dismiss by our application name.\n",
      "Let is see what I is going to to forward because just but yeah, whether I should we should be for so you first create communities based on.\n",
      "Let is that I do not know to I take a because the but in normally is getting good lot right the page.\n",
      "Let is go ahead and get started here and so first thing but going to do in the macro builder just on terms point wrong in this in terms of initially choosing their backgrounds the load but by outside of that we are just going use some of this approvals background.\n",
      "I like can point out video loss sponsor, which offers thousands of clases they design coding is this more for instance instance they are about to watch my video on side systems we you good watch this only course I still here now skill sharing just ten some but if do the first new when to use my exclusively link load in this me here you me to then you get first to lunch three right let us get started every like silent up cetera.\n",
      "So instead is giving a own what I think just thought we the better give you more examples around the internet of what others need to be system right first off one ninety.\n",
      "This is just a person the runs future if you have your own in into device you do not need to include this, but recommended if we are entty and we can recommendations the choice and then you you might need to type in your pasword to allow it to I context and now that we are running in studio.\n",
      "I between to or model navigation and like this by to this background here or you meaning you want to have something like.\n",
      "Just a bit bigger okay, so android in the activity right now we are inside the activities.\n",
      "So so it is thirty and you are taking on the experience from this is very minor change the minor difference to even say that one is better not saying that it will something is like on want have you know mean so all all used to so that sharing having defined having following and on version since that are asking they are any extent on let me there is one is there that they are some good.\n",
      "So hopefully my guy is called us today is question brain are you html all right so go ahead let know in the comments I will comment it with the merchant comment my answer in the let us head he gets our let us go ahead and get started you just said Dolby be confidence time for this.\n",
      "I guess I am going to do a little bit of use me these on this question watched the video and then let me know if you thought I did a good job or alright with first one side system.\n",
      "So the day we are going to take look at what our note looking at thing internet definition with design taking the and this one a vague now uploading route a dev days and so I am gonna help break that all down.\n",
      "Fine what something one just of these two only to you next still got for you to change that time.\n",
      "Yeah and then only community you doing you are are dating of this code for here yeah, so we had not this where you are based on that your value sample from from one having that good data from the same because meeting, but that need.\n",
      "Now one thing call out so pretty it need to use instead with of technologies looks cool about out as it does not just use inside by using the strings which let Jeans use together.\n",
      "He started all this stuff then components it here and a lot of times I depending on through which these is looking at with a creating it tweaks all for images months right so we have second yeah, I would consider meet really much patterns.\n",
      "We need to center bton to center something in a constrained layout you just constraint it to both both left and right side the blood track those left side to the platform and the right side right also you may have noticed that we have two screens here last one is showing us what the absolute bton and the one is more of the blue you showing us of the little details but that.\n",
      "It the logical way having Stuart go grab if you were the around the that I think of the launch this need to be clear logic point and if you btons on an side that we need to rank is complaint bton and you do not care and what it has learning inside all that should not giving given this enterprises because of the same being in our object.\n",
      "Development is a great way to turn your and reality or of and getting started is probably is these days development is done the tool on Android studio studio is kind of like the Microsoft version writing android.\n",
      "I working with them or selling now stuff and they even purpose having it is signed any systems try to everything everyone is on so they a voice section leaving there is just lot of different stuff.\n",
      "More so you just black me not me dad by just case here it just quite well with it like you guys.\n",

So the focus choose between a bunch of options who make an happen. Let is specify how many options that are and this one to random when we click a bton.

However, identifying the right strategies to market your business is often likened to rocket science.  Some businesses have been built solely on the backs of social media. How do you get your message to the right audience and do it effectively? How do you boost visibility and increase sales while sustaining a profit with a converting offer? Today, with so much vying for our attention from social media, to search engine optimization, blogging and pay-per-click advertising, it's easy to see why most are ready to pull their hair out.The truth is that what got you to this point in business is likely not going to get you to the next level. If you're feeling stuck, join the fray. Most entrepreneurs are so busy working 'in' their businesses that they fail to work 'on' their businesses.

Yes, it good point to start because that master that the language that you choose hmmm from you know from I mean most of this is come from experiences both working at living to where we working on a model and moving to Groupon, which was a heavy presented company a with a huge model in between so some of the learning that we took from that was before getting into model the micro services. There is something that I be very was do not come a framework frameworks like Ruby or something that is too allows some invoices from kind of practices upon the developer and sort of expects the about the right code such that will only work well written in that order and to word away from the same words, you know specific in a workings and things will kind of make you words from the community around view also right. So especially when we work then like one of model and rails backend group on one of the biggest problems are things like handling database connections across different regions. You know using the appropriate data connection database connection or you only your master et cetera and you have to do a lot of to get that in where we go in have had to had chosen the right form of abstraction and design patterns that are put in place and will allow us to easily move with logic or handle much well the second thing was at least some other framework.\"\n",

So so with respect to that the problem with Java the one of the two main part Java of was types so when you had to great clases and yet to create interfaces. We have to say this clas implemented interface and make sure that you try to not try to get in exactly the dependency place and worry about those things and unless the clas does not provide implement interface even though it has all the messages. It does not work out definitely at that point time was somewhat shaky if the Java had been introduced because not as efficient as go she was or not easy to manage the way go had done with respect to go things in the way managers in admin manner scale was interesting because it is a functional program language for the problem was there were just not easy for developers to get onboard with and the bigger problem was that it had a functional.\"\n",

I ideally like that a lot but again I because it to the list of the foundation of the language is very small. There is not a lot of things that learn about the language to go work. Yeah, but that because also that it is list most people uncomfortable, especially because when we started it. We need people with media processing background. These will go at work especially on lower level systems and plus plus with handling network related itself are heavily comfortable of as a language and to train them do not just learn like how to write high level software was one concern that Wouldve happen regardless of what language. We choose but on top of that piece then my whole different paradigm. I am of writing go reading code would just be another concern at that point right it also had good teams in so also nice and the way the languages was defined and maintained by the core team was very nice open changes they are are now going to do introduce changes are already stable you can use one want which is a big bonus because we get to follow the and also.\"\n",

Lot of things are pretty good things like in there are some inheritance which is when you are not a experience program or integrating them and understanding them understand things like you know solid principles etc takes a lot of time and takes a lot of experience for them to understand you know interface segments and cost principal etc. Then you should use a channel clas and you should do the parent clas cetera and that sometimes is not easily available.

So that is where we thought the key architecture that was as that has been spoken about for so long was useful in that process where they force use of but not frameworks right. So using the right interface was important for us. So it does not matter what remove it as long it user. The right set of abstractions to how doing so that is the first thing right and and it starts to choosing name model versus Micro service. Now once you have clean architecture in place you do not really need to think about whether guess when come to place there are automatically good design patterns and concerns that automatically get in force by which you can commit code to the team report at least before getting to tomorrow services and later decide whether they orders split them or move them based on deployment concerns or how they are scale.

It is a model that is the right word model fine means that entire deployment sort of lies in one process, which it is not so we do separate the contents when is required like the end separated from the backend end the platform go platform some of the deployment deployment concerns like let us socket gateway or something else which requires that own scale concerns or maybe need to be exposed to the outside world, but does not need to track me they are generally they deprived separately this, but they do end up who be hosted in same people. So we follow model architecture see and domain driven design this help defining what bound context the systems interact with and how you go about creating like the this separating deployment or wiring audio system from the core business logical systems containing packages.

Sometimes cannot this important for one to think about can I use a light while you store in general, but sometimes you might have to query by certain with different differently in narrow.

So to give an example, list like at least in the ruby, you would have a forward all models right and you put the meeting entty put the transcription entty you put like contextual core object like an entty detail into the same folder essentially and by doing so what is happening is within that photo people do not try to create tight between those entties.

So the clean architecture domain design essentially the idea behind that is the philosophy that you have domain experts in know really well about how systems work especially any commerce platform. Youre have in monthly products in inventory units et cetera around those jargon should be introduced in the system and we use the way it meant to be used like in a traditional supply same. So you have to domain person or something about just mean you have developers developers who can write code. So it was to bring that knowledge on developers or to sort reach that gap and I have them usually work on the business logic that is one other core pieces clean architecture. What it was was template essentially of how one should be thinking about affecting your business from code business data that only updates on changes in the business logic or things like is the lowest level unit basically lowest level unit that the knowledge of the right and then you sort of add layers on top of them about maybe you can have a business where you give all the data the compettion gives you some insights or something and that you need to operate on then you have them around me a service layer or a controller basically that talks to different features of the system. Maybe you want to talk to a database you want to talk to cash system going to do some io. We will our some services to get some data you to gather all the information that you want and send it down to the layer down to perform the compettion give you the result that we can probably back words that is like the control or the service we call this.\",\n",

We can just do a computer role, but if you want to do which given the nature of the system that we are building is it does not require that amount of consistency just just we lucky in that manner, but in some place you been my so we end up having to create another layer of sections or things you tag up bton and like that where you want to have a some an might use and responsibilities, but they operate on the events.

So for that we need none the that all requests reply kind of items right or all that what we need is so we use that which is the system that we use for to support request like also that it the good thing about it is it does support responsive, but more importantly we use it for messages and aiming that is so what we should be doing for all internal communication. We should be using which is more reliable for sending for creating more events and having with and on them.

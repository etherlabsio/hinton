That's this process that runs which is responsible for communicating with yes, you the cluster services and so this whole thing the cluster services.

It's issue out and it makes request to the server and is which response so that you can update itself and has a continually information.

It doesn't make exist you have doc*mentation right.

There are a lot of libraries and languages that not a good fit for it don't support it well.

I point out those the make sense how do we fit this into the practical paradigm because there are plenty of things that don't fit well into the rest paradigm. If inefficient right it's all tech space which is great for information but when you actually like want to do things really quickly and you want to use this little of the network as possible like maybe you are on a mobile client that's working on hugely connection and the insert parts of the world trouble and and even if you did fix all these things like internally you like exposed and API guys with someone else in your company and they are so very rarely they're actually just like oh well, I stood up an end point for you and doing it in here's body and it's not all is no like resource that it creates like outside and.\", \"transcriptId\": \"e5d99e59-c595-4730-84c1-2239078a7eff\"},{\"id\": \"78a0328db391498aa5e81adee7612761\", \"status\": \"revoked\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-08-07T15:41:36Z\", \"duration\": 61, \"spokenBy\": \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-08-07T15:41:37.133526683Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-08-07T15:40:35Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-08-07T15:41:40.86662563Z\", \"confidence\": 0.87227035, \"recordingId\": \"f373414b07ac41179db21df2894b0d37\", \"transcriber\": \"deepgram\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"Like a different customers.

It's a query language for your a I that's entirely. Unlike anything that you ever used before in terms of a standard API. So in other apis that you hit to get data. Let's say you want to fetch data from the YouTube API and you can say hey YouTube give me this information in way those typically work is that you have a specific end point or a uRL that you're hitting and that you R determines what data comes back and you can pa*s options their you urL L and that can change the sheet of the data or maybe what comes back in it but at the end of the day was a normal what's called a api you fetch a url and the U R is returning typically something like Json or javascript to object full of data. And so this is how it's worked for a while now right before that we typically we work with exit now and stuff like that no API is a typically reason essentially just rest a p i's for a long time. Now what makes great you well new and exciting and different well for needs to improve a upon those sort of ideas. So instead of the API where you hit the URL and just except whatever data coming back allows you to ask for specific kinds of data. This may be hard to see with the screen, but in this example, that's to well that or you can see that we've defined.\", \"transcriptId\": \"e5d99e59-c595-4730-84c1-2239078a7eff\"},{\"id\": \"e7937bd984d04e98a27bc1513949d7f0\", \"status\": \"revoked\", \"deleted\": false, \"endTime\": \"2019-08-07T15:46:58Z\", \"duration\": 120, \"spokenBy\": \"31a3ba4761854ad9a041ddf1c4c6a1dc\", \"createdAt\": \"2019-08-07T15:46:59.151959788Z\", \"deletedAt\": null, \"startTime\": \"2019-08-07T15:44:58Z\", \"updatedAt\": \"2019-08-07T15:47:02.842361819Z\", \"confidence\": 0.97957045, \"recordingId\": \"177cfbca900b426dbbcccac3ee3b3d81\", \"transcriber\": \"deepgram\", \"languageCode\": \"en-US\", \"originalText\": \"Is a way our data looks right as a project with the name of Tagline and contributors. Then you ask for what you want right? So this is the actual queries so instead of hitting an API just accepting data you say hey give me the project was the name of and return it that add okay and then the results come back with exactly what you asked for which is a object with project and rather than just a whole bunch of stuff maybe you ask work didn't have to no decision to build three that you are going to use you allows for really excellent relational queries and I'll show you what I mean here in a real environment in a second that allows you to well safe trips for instance, the YouTube API I keep going this one with the YouTube apI you hit it and you get a list of videos which is essentially the video I IDS but if you want all of the information about that particular video you have to then go back to the API and you have to oh yeah so okay I got this. Now that I have this idea pay you YouTube once more to tell me all of the information about this video when great you can do this an extremely relational queries that only make it. So you have to do one trip one trip for the API data comes back. Okay so is a query language is a way to get data from an API into your application. So to well, well, two actually a specification and the fact that graph was created by Facebook is one of those things I can worry people they can say well I don't I don't want to use some Facebook technology because of maybe Facebook reputation.

So you're not stuck using Facebook projects and there's for a lot of interesting ideas not only that but you can use graph to well on any sort of platform. So if we went to the code part of this site you can see that of two parts right. There's the server component and there's the client component. Now if an a P i has a graph to server that already exist. You can just use that with only right? Well you need to learn the server side stuff but if you're building a full stack app such as level of tutorials you need a server library as well. So the call part l is that there's just all this choice. So you can see that we go to server libraries and there's categories where you can find to implementation and all of these different languages. And if I were to select Javascript. You can see that well we have some options too well that crack too. Well we have a follow server which is what I'm using and all of these are great because again we i gives us options to use something let me explain a little bit while with the server actually the server essentially takes in your API you write your API as a series of type definitions.

It is a query language for your a I that is entirely. Unlike anything that you ever used before in terms of a standard API. So in other apis that you hit to get data. Let is say you want to fetch data from the YouTube API and you can say hey YouTube give me this information in way those typically work is that you have a specific end point or a uRL that you are hitting and that you R determines what data comes back and you can pas options their you urL L and that can change the sheet of the data or maybe what comes back in it but at the end of the day was a normal what is called a api you fetch a url and the U R is returning typically something like Json or javascript to object full of data. And so this is how it is worked for a while now right before that we typically we work with exit now and stuff like that no API is a typically reason essentially just rest a p i is for a long time. Now what makes great you well new and exciting and different well for needs to improve a upon those sort of ideas. So instead of the API where you hit the URL and just except whatever data coming back allows you to ask for specific kinds of data.

Now that I have this idea pay you YouTube once more to tell me all of the information about this video when great you can do this an extremely relational queries that only make it. So you have to do one trip one trip for the API data comes back. Okay so is a query language is a way to get data from an API into your application.

      "Let is say you want to fetch data from the YouTube API and you can say hey YouTube give me this information in way those typically work is that you have a specific end point or a uRL that you are hitting and that you R determines what data comes back and you can pas options their you urL L and that can change the sheet of the data or maybe what comes back in it but at the end of the day was a normal what is called a api you fetch a url and the U R is returning typically something like Json or javascript to object full of data.\n",
      "So this is the actual queries so instead of hitting an API just accepting data you say hey give me the project was the name of and return it that add okay and then the results come back with exactly what you asked for which is a object with project and rather than just a whole bunch of stuff maybe you ask work did not have to no decision to build three that you are going to use you allows for really excellent relational queries and I will show you what I mean here in a real environment in a second that allows you to well safe trips for instance, the YouTube API I keep going this one with the YouTube apI you hit it and you get a list of videos which is essentially the video I IDS but if you want all of the information about that particular video you have to then go back to the API and you have to oh yeah so okay I got this.\n",
      "There is there is a and we will talk about it later but you have you have touching you go to a website some of the rest the works and these are the parameters the evening expect but if you want to point a machine as the rest API and say like can you tell me the proper use of this end endpoint and what parameters it accepts and what types that success you do not have that and so that means that when you want to right client libraries you have to get humans to do it and zoom expensive and they do not like right client libraries streaming is difficult to rest you very rarely streaming in rest guys because most libraries.\n",
      "Well we have a follow server which is what I am using and all of these are great because again we i gives us options to use something let me explain a little bit while with the server actually the server essentially takes in your API you write your API as a series of type definitions.\n",
      "Just to give very high level flow of what really happens and indexing when are using your framework like you will do soon so that docment looking and not using nothing like so initially be to the connections process or a bunch of records or docments.\n",
      "So is most of the time will in investing index need a structure model which will be covering it so so for we will just target it as these other the two key tests for the things of message which happens into the index flow so on the bottom right you may notice.\n",
      "So the docments has to be and devoted into tokens or those so a docment can have safe right example can treat as definitely we can example, I can see it docment could be having lost of something like this about you so that.\n",
      "Let is work on one so I am going to have one replica one pod one replica to replica three in addition I have also got a part team so here we are pod to replica one and in this case we have two replica or so let us just do someone replica to you and you you see at any point time the cluster services are responsible to make sure that configuration is running the across of my container host or or my workers.\n",
      "If this is exactly what happens so once the docment or text is a alyze it is sent to the the list the stream of text into each word or those posts of the people use it automatically token or or whatever it is most probably we use is token or so once the token collaboration is done.\n",
      "So what is an operating system every time usage one your computer you see great you can perform different activities like right does the internet of what is the what is it that makes the computer hardware look like that how does the process on your computer.\n",
      "So these why you mean in that anything to make sure that efficiency of the data which is stored is easily easily the email most efficient and the fast way and without in getting scrutiny and a pool for like a full table you will be aiming up consuming more resources resources to coordinate those docments.\n",
      "So looking at this right direct connection the browsers is it sort of sounds right like web socket for not really so the keyword here is direct can form sockets is what happens is there is a connection or communication between only the the client the server.\n",
      "Going me wrong Json and are great they have I mean there is a reason that all of the web service aPis have been built practically the lab ten at that rough designs and just like the very most basic reasons why like we do not have to go over these things like we all notice but like they are easy to understand right like they are they are a tech based part value and look it up like we have so many great tools right that all been builds around the system even before right the fact that this already how the works is via and content negotiation like the fact that we can build apis using those tools using the way that the web all work was it was great right and it has lots of other great things going for is like the fact that they really agreement limitations because of the fact that that is other way works but I have to tell you something if I never write another client library in my life.\n",
      "So if one of the client changes something or make a update and saying they typing text or notify the it send it to the server the server processes of information and immediately push topics all the other clients and what is process does is that it there is actually a sort of delay right.\n",
      "So how does the server knows this is defined and it is not just someone pertaining to be the client the name the ttle of data that is sending over is thing with voice check is it just from random files was that is over that there is math for universal.\n",
      "No, I forgot these sharing right on and see got I do not really want to use your your library and this is is a problem for businesses right who exposed these eight guys to their customers, but it is also a problem internally when your building applications he build an application and you say you to another team.\n",
      "So what I have done is I actually dropped this pod one replica to so therefore the schedule has to make a scheduling decision on where I need to extend that so you will just pick one of the workers loops.\n",
      "Easily in so which is pretty simple to is a very simple Java or library used to index data and third data because in any search application by this time we have figured it out that are two aspects which is very critical way how the data has to store what we call it as the index data the process that itself is called as index and secondary three do it is way how we query that in index data.\n",
      "One of the main components that I can what to call out is this a that in part of all this the API services so that is one global block of the system the second building block of the system is this thing called a worker and what is a worker or the marker is really just a container host the one thing unique about a worker were the container host environment is that it.\n",
      "Same the best part is that great is a specification is not an implementation as in you do not see an install graph Q anywhere on this site that is because you to use well you need to use an implementation of graph you up and one of the coolest things about it is that because it is just as stack there is compettion in the implementation space.\n",
      "Is a pot configuration and a is like the smallest unit of deployment in terms of the model and what it means is that you pod I can have running containers and you can have one more more.\n",
      "So we only have one particular end point which is typically, but you can actually set it to be anything you like and that is the graphical server right and allows you on any sort of server environment to be able to expose this information the possibility of and an implementation like Apollo is absolutely no notification having server libraries or implementation.\n",
      "That is this process that runs which is responsible for communicating with yes, you the cluster services and so this whole thing the cluster services.\n",
      "But what web you this changes fundamentally the browsers because now browsers can communicate each other server.\n",
      "Hey, you integrate with my service like can you can you build me a library I do not want build you library for that anyways can tell on.\n",
      "It is not the protocols that you are using the actual protocols that most rest APIs are based on pieces our and Json and rest is kind of like the architectural principle how you structure your API when you are using and Json and that is how we build eight guys the parts each other.\n",
      "Not to user friendly as they were used by computer and store never has some money to this product since definitely scope to operating system when those got famous left the open source aspect of the alytics operating system.\n",
      "Server and clients client would signal to the server like and say something along the lines of hey I need to talk to the hairs my information the server then take that too fine say hey finally what is to talk to your you success and chronic is sure is my information the that takes that back to client and okay.\n",
      "So the docment itself again cannot be stored as is after the alysis and doing some sort of be possible.\n",
      "I will print it to the API and it will be to the cost services to figure out how to schedule these pods in the environment and make sure that I have the right number of pause running.\n",
      "Well you need to learn the server side stuff but if you are building a full stack app such as level of tutorials you need a server library as well.\n",
      "So how to these clients even know about each other how they I know client is a connected to that you have not enjoyed ttle itself so that how it knows.\n",
      "So before it gets stored into the index it has to the way how the docments has been is an excellent docment that is the very pure text docment.\n",
      "The sort through all of it most of us rely to engine the plan what we want and these search engines have become.\n",
      "So you can see that we go to server libraries and there is categories where you can find to implementation and all of these different languages.\n",
      "So all those alysis has to have to upfront because the docment cannot these two has is for connections and it has to be our first time to some sort of feeling communication before it can be submitted to the index.\n",
      "So between the sending clients and the server and the server processing all of information we need to on the right will have to just sit there and wait normally like this is nothing issue it is probably only a second, but if there is a huge issue it comes down to voice chat or live streaming where one second can change a lot of things.\n",
      "So the work only compute you need an operating system in fact, you are using one as you need this on computer.\n",
      "So this is the same technique which should be very the search applications on first framework.\n",
      "So offers are very powerful features of indexing the content to easily research on the docments or on the records and easily they treat those docments.\n",
      "I point out those the make sense how do we fit this into the practical paradigm because there are plenty of things that do not fit well into the rest paradigm.\n",
      "It is issue out and it makes request to the server and is which response so that you can update itself and has a continually information.\n",
      "It is currently used in pure and sharing and traffic and it transfers sort of like metadata data from the browser such as Browser our information ports and many more and there is is security.\n",
      "So if you there is this sole idea can you all know this idea it is an idea that is expressed for example in the clasic clasic.\n",
      "So it is all the does send the data really need just that data.\n",
      "Really what that mean, I am going to see the cluster services is a specific configuration and it will be enough to the cluster services to go out and run that configuration in my infrastructure.\n",
      "One is dial operations one is dialing and one is get so in a initiate call and then get a call and you can see so there is the service definition call and you see two methods and you see the dial takes the parameter called dial and in return the call and then there is another message called and take the get and returns the call people though that is in a dial right.\n",
      "So this is sort of what happens behind the scenes first of course everything goes through the API so the developer interact with the API of the client and so users this API to set up the collection.\n",
      "Is where you actually are able to accept the queries on the front end to the graph and point and ask for the data you want to receive and again with Javascript.\n",
      "Is a way our data looks right as a project with the name of Tagline and contributors.\n",
      "He thought of logic or which will be responsive to the changes modifications suggested by users device the kernel alytics in ninety ninety one.\n",
      "They are the worst aPIs except for all the other ones.\n",
      "--------------cluster 1------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "If inefficient right it is all tech space which is great for information but when you actually like want to do things really quickly and you want to use this little of the network as possible like maybe you are on a mobile client that is working on hugely connection and the insert parts of the world trouble and and even if you did fix all these things like internally you like exposed and API guys with someone else in your company and they are so very rarely they are actually just like oh well, I stood up an end point for you and doing it in here is body and it is not all is no like resource that it creates like outside and.\n",
      "Yeah, yep how do also been invented or creating by I think so it is a very powerful Java Library hundred focus source and purely Java is based on top of losing that is the reason why we are trying to understand what you is and in details will be getting into the much more absolutely in the part.\n",
      "This I one of the people you talked to when you call us your have you wondered how to tell more people find a website well here host almost two million websites and we have a lot of experience helping client essentially increase web one of the best ways to do this is through what is called search and optimization where for shortly.\n",
      "So that is what we will use in this video just keep in mind the cost we are discussing applying all the other engine do when you search for something with Google you get back a result page and there is wants to stuff on it just shows how many website google now that are probably relevant to what you are looking for here companies can pay Google like ads for a people search particular things but this section most people care about is the actual results list which is the list of website that are most likely to contain what you are working important and you will notice this is just the first page you can click down there from now here is is the important part that most people just about or four percent of people a use only quick results on this first page if they do not find a village for they usually do not bother looking up those them whole pages instead they typically be preferred to just adjust their search terms and start and of those people who do click on that first most only click and what refer to add the golden Triangle or top three or so results and back about fifty three percent of people just click right.\n",
      "So trying that is a best to know whether the next or not I must to learn and why next is the mother of the operating systems which laid out the foundation to can connections design mainly for and used it enterprises while that is fast becoming a hospital rate for computer users the final and so and fine.\n",
      "Parallel between us are easy to be that my for ninety nine I actually have a chapter on the necessity of having a charge view of life and I you speak who like just now it is tragic you would apply and ironically if you do not have that you cannot be happy.\n",
      "I once you say if you want to learn a little bit more about the course of than hour or so the syntax dot decent text podcast which is less boss myself we just an entire episode on graph you so you watch this video and you think hey that sounds cool I want to learn a little bit more to text of it and check out the latest episode is on you.\n",
      "I will asking that I hate writing libraries and yet when you are building lots of API lots of web services you create me like yeah I made a web API and someone like hey did you like I do not want to work with an clients to right a library and like man.\n",
      "So to well, well, two actually a specification and the fact that graph was created by Facebook is one of those things I can worry people they can say well I do not I do not want to use some Facebook technology because of maybe Facebook reputation.\n",
      "I never met new person I ever met leadership in person but I said to him when we met before lunch something that is said to me by so many people who we need for the first time I feel like I know you and I there is the highest compliment in in effect I now understand what a compliment that is what I receive it because I never gave it to somebody before you and I have watched you for hours and listen to you and read book and in fact I did not just read your book i heard your book from you so I want to tell you something without embarrasing it but I think I like to you open your heart and your mind and so do i. I was very only I realized that God or made sure had given me I have called a detector and I knew I always knew and when I was in the presence of a good person because that is all I really care about.\n",
      "It is quite overwhelming you you did not just read that book you will not say you saying it but I like that you use music come very much it so this is the man that honored to have the dialogue with because you are everybody knows you are bright but I know you are good.\n",
      "I mean even more specific than that is like how do we build web apis and I think we all know how we build web apis and it is so no, it is not it is not so it is not so it is rest only it is really not for is actually like an architectural principle.\n",
      "With that said let us actually answer this question what is graph to well now you well is a query language in fact that is what the t l would stand more.\n",
      "What matter a lot more was whether those pieces were signed off them by other people so they my concept to search they suggested websites that were back a lot that is to say we are refer to often by other websites are more likely to be relevant that was more.\n",
      "Dont take it mean, this is why I got motivate to do what I have been doing and I have been doing what I have been doing for I would say since of nine seventy nine and one form or another the things take a long time to generate one of the things I learned in the early a was that people have a agreed to capacity super for and I did not really understand that myself until.\n",
      "So I will not I will not into basically what it is is the technique that establish a connection between the clients.\n",
      "It is I am adding a thousand essentially and I heard you leave your book the pasion comes from I just want to help people leave a better life and it is really it.\n",
      "Talk about what is web what does not it do how it works and what is going on behind the scene just talk some of the challenges that this new technology is and why it is useful to learn and use.\n",
      "I I am sure there are nice people there but I do not understand this but I always picked it up that and I I have always been right?\n",
      "--------------cluster 2------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "There is is the problems who want talk about those and so the question your like this speaks all these things and it does and I will so let us design a to API not like a whole one that that would take ten.\n",
      "And so this is how it is worked for a while now right before that we typically we work with exit now and stuff like that no API is a typically reason essentially just rest a p i is for a long time.\n",
      "And if you want to do something like streaming you just so that is difficult they are also of like I cannot tell you the number of conversations I have having anyone designing in a or sounds like all man this operation restart machine like all what do we do do we post the restart.\n",
      "This while I optimizing in your best research or doing seo is so important when people search something that is relevant for them and they see your website on the results the guy clip and this of your page and these are just any visitors these are people that we are looking for exactly what you offer.\n",
      "So that is it is super important because of helps you move to the top of relevance results almost everyone realized how on to find anything online seo is the most effective ways to English traffic your site good takes time.\n",
      "So the when you start asuming you move up the resolve lab to learn more about you watch our next video how to grow your business with seo this our house center or to give us the call we have Seo standing by the and as always like subscribe or follow us to get the latest involves as special person.\n",
      "So it is just another example of of the that you are getting this message out if you want to comment at that that if not on the one I watch you when your such an intense listener.\n",
      "Now that I have this idea pay you YouTube once more to tell me all of the information about this video when great you can do this an extremely relational queries that only make it.\n",
      "It is almost quite your website does not exist no one team upon it now in our example research for California and we got back about twenty two million not exactly small number you ever wondered why somewhat straight on the sprint page and others a step way down at the bottom of well a site position resulted determined by what is refer to add eight every website has a ranking for particular sort terms or keywords in the beginning.\n",
      "This is where you reasure your site is full of keywords that are relevant to you are site about.\n",
      "Inside this there can be a whole bunch of configuration information than got to bypas quite a bit of it brand that I talked about the first of which in this deployment file.\n",
      "So the of at was not so my client can actually directly communicate with each other and complete bypas the server.\n",
      "Thank you wait I have a and update is that rest actually not aggregate rest apis.\n",
      "What is graph Qa hopefully I have that answered very quickly for you here and before he call it.\n",
      "You may have to for to explain him while the next for the commands used important opening systems are usually the same.\n",
      "So I it is today all all this model they still look at your website keyword but they did not rank your sites relevant on a number quality of back to it from other.\n",
      "So he would leave programmes like five manager docment added audio video programs to grant on it something as you have a call with noise street on the top as time pas he collaborated other group parameters places like ninety and applications alytics started to appear so around ninety.\n",
      "This is where I do work to create to your website that originally from others sources links your site to be created using articles social media blog posts discussion boards and but ether mind the morning legitimate the that links back to you the more affect that background from that side going to have on your search development.\n",
      "Now often millions of program and applications which choose from that the installed no longer need providers is a highly system also things local development community constantly looking at ways to enhance that security upgrade the operating system because more and next system to.\n",
      "Theyre constantly changing based people actually do out there on the web surprisingly as there are these two aspects how engines fine pages search core components that you first hit the compliance.\n",
      "It is easy to confuse that with other human beings you know it is a different thing to understand that it is true yourself have to recommend I still that they be history as a and not as a big hero and people very seldom do that and it is no wonder but I would say perhaps that I became terrified enough from learning.\n",
      "So if you search for California handle you get that list of websites containing those two and the websites that have those words most awesome rank higher and they showed up for the top over all pages well in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six to page notice whether they were researching papers.\n",
      "So I want to see that at the else I I had something to shave about that good.\n",
      "Your practical Q A I via Endpoint remember I mentioned that whole rest API is you doing and then right?\n",
      "Theyre are essentially same since is lot of so learning what the same as learning another.\n",
      "You can see that well we have some options too well that crack too.\n",
      "So is it for uses what alytics usually shut it by force during it as a and technical an operating system to operate but to state June in the last few years.\n",
      "So let us just will take a look at this and try to understand what this means right so normally on fine is really just a browser.\n",
      "So what are benefits of use learning the next now enjoy populated.\n",
      "Now what makes great you well new and exciting and different well for needs to improve a upon those sort of ideas.\n",
      "That will be hard one end in this case this is replica.\n",
      "I think brains are wildly over me that is why I think you are not bright if you join events why you would want to announce to the world.\n",
      "We would be touch what losing is or about why we have to really more about losing and what it creating offers us to next door.\n",
      "So for example, if you sell handles california you want to make sure keywords words on site like California Ocean reach leather fan things like that the second component of CEO is called side.\n",
      "The goal of this video is to give you a basic overview of how retention port it.\n",
      "Well would practical you hit one end point and then ask through the stuff you want.\n",
      "So the way how index in index those those stuff is something called.\n",
      "So he have to be able to index as I said half to in week every day but also make that.\n",
      "You can just use that with only right?\n",
      "Youre be in our cloud hypotheses and and the session is all about giving days to you in five minutes and it is going to be a little bit of a challenge.\n",
      "Best Google see your site and know what about back determine how much Google trusts your site to be relevant.\n",
      "So pod number two and I basically have container number three and then replica like a configuration file equal to two.\n",
      "So when they does is being spent and cash web is are automatically chris any type data.\n",
      "So in this case what we want to do is feed this the configuration.\n",
      "But about eight three percent of people worldwide why use Google.\n",

      "They it more now the is call the attention for mean advantage of the was that parameters were able to use kernel in order to design people custom operating systems.\n",
      "This has now point of the most popular and widely used cousin and it is the fact goal of of low systems like and a list an end here as they are thousands so for systems based on the next which offer a applied functions to the users.\n",
      "Web is is so this in itself is not really an issue but this of protocol call any P reliable for answering important data.\n",
      "You can go and do a small look of kind of a into some sort can those docments technique do the way how the books are index stored all the phases or at the back of the page.\n",
      "So you guys have got about the famous guide the cutting who is the data of much more powerful framework are than losing even losing his being created by cutting so its very powerful.\n",
      "So what is the next time who created it next is an operating system or a which as an idea in the mind of right in store that he was the computer stood it used to work on the or and thought that needed did improve.\n",
      "We do not have sell hundreds of dollars get you alternate interesting like those bills as developers are important the knowledge can modify.\n",
      "So that way is someone working somehow how this experience in this transfer a data they will not be able to contain any initial resource information.\n",
      "The same that clients and with that part collection the primary out that directly calculate being and the server nothing about it.\n",
      "But I understand it so if you know want to you.\n",
      "So what is what is the unique scenario that happen to what happens if I lose a worker.\n",
      "This works is a program and heart of any our system that takes care of fundamental stuff like hardware committing with software.\n",
      "What is marketplace, you stand for what real time communication.\n",
      "So you can better understand with retention optimization more seo is all about as of today.\n",
      "How does this work and what is information is client a sending to the server and receiving.\n",
      "So there is a different architectural components too, which I going to talk about the first of which is the companies cluster services.\n",

Now what makes great you well new and exciting and different well for needs to improve a upon those sort of ideas.

Now that I have this idea pay you YouTube once more to tell me all of the information about this video when great you can do this an extremely relational queries that only make it.

So let us just will take a look at this and try to understand what this means right so normally on fine is really just a browser. It is issue out and it makes request to the server and is which response so that you can update itself and has a continually information. But what web you this changes fundamentally the browsers because now browsers can communicate each other server. So how to these clients even know about each other how they I know client is a connected to that you have not enjoyed ttle itself so that how it knows. So when we can get in example this is.',\n",

I think brains are wildly over me that is why I think you are not bright if you join events why you would want to announce to the world. Youre like Q so to me. I I am sure there are nice people there but I do not understand this but I always picked it up that and I I have always been right? It is I am adding a thousand essentially and I heard you leave your book the pasion comes from I just want to help people leave a better life and it is really it. It is quite overwhelming you you did not just read that book you will not say you saying it but I like that you use music come very much it so this is the man that honored to have the dialogue with because you are everybody knows you are bright but I know you are good.

I mean even more specific than that is like how do we build web apis and I think we all know how we build web apis and it is so no, it is not it is not so it is not so it is rest only it is really not for is actually like an architectural principle. It is not the protocols that you are using the actual protocols that most rest APIs are based on pieces our and Json and rest is kind of like the architectural principle how you structure your API when you are using and Json and that is how we build eight guys the parts each other.

I will asking that I hate writing libraries and yet when you are building lots of API lots of web services you create me like yeah I made a web API and someone like hey did you like I do not want to work with an clients to right a library and like man. No, I forgot these sharing right on and see got I do not really want to use your your library and this is is a problem for businesses right who exposed these eight guys to their customers, but it is also a problem internally when your building applications he build an application and you say you to another team. Hey, you integrate with my service like can you can you build me a library I do not want build you library for that anyways can tell on. I hit right client libraries, but there are lots of reasons that the rest is not as good as it could be and so like I was saying that is one. \n",

      "2019-08-07 15:38:35   Like the reason that you have the right client library is because there is no formal machine readable definition of a rest API. It does not make exist you have docmentation right. There is there is a and we will talk about it later but you have you have touching you go to a website some of the rest the works and these are the parameters the evening expect but if you want to point a machine as the rest API and say like can you tell me the proper use of this end endpoint and what parameters it accepts and what types that success you do not have that and so that means that when you want to right client libraries you have to get humans to do it and zoom expensive and they do not like right client libraries streaming is difficult to rest you very rarely streaming in rest guys because most libraries. There are a lot of libraries and languages that not a good fit for it do not support it well. And if you want to do something like streaming you just so that is difficult they are also of like I cannot tell you the number of conversations I have having anyone designing in a or sounds like all man this operation restart machine like all what do we do do we post the restart. I point out those the make sense how do we fit this into the practical paradigm because there are plenty of things that do not fit well into the rest paradigm. If inefficient right it is all tech space which is great for information but when you actually like want to do things really quickly and you want to use this little of the network as possible like maybe you are on a mobile client that is working on hugely connection and the insert parts of the world trouble and and even if you did fix all these things like internally you like exposed and API guys with someone else in your company and they are so very rarely they are actually just like oh well, I stood up an end point for you and doing it in here is body and it is not all is no like resource that it creates like outside and. \n",

There is is the problems who want talk about those and so the question your like this speaks all these things and it does and I will so let us design a to API not like a whole one that that would take ten. So this is a it supports to function calls. One is dial operations one is dialing and one is get so in a initiate call and then get a call and you can see so there is the service definition call and you see two methods and you see the dial takes the parameter called dial and in return the call and then there is another message called and take the get and returns the call people though that is in a dial right. Okay? Well set by the two and the problem and the. \n",

What is graph Qa hopefully I have that answered very quickly for you here and before he call it. I once you say if you want to learn a little bit more about the course of than hour or so the syntax dot decent text podcast which is less boss myself we just an entire episode on graph you so you watch this video and you think hey that sounds cool I want to learn a little bit more to text of it and check out the latest episode is on you. \n",

      "2019-08-07 15:43:04   With that said let us actually answer this question what is graph to well now you well is a query language in fact that is what the t l would stand more. It is a query language for your a I that is entirely. Unlike anything that you ever used before in terms of a standard API. So in other apis that you hit to get data. Let is say you want to fetch data from the YouTube API and you can say hey YouTube give me this information in way those typically work is that you have a specific end point or a uRL that you are hitting and that you R determines what data comes back and you can pas options their you urL L and that can change the sheet of the data or maybe what comes back in it but at the end of the day was a normal what is called a api you fetch a url and the U R is returning typically something like Json or javascript to object full of data. And so this is how it is worked for a while now right before that we typically we work with exit now and stuff like that no API is a typically reason essentially just rest a p i is for a long time. Now what makes great you well new and exciting and different well for needs to improve a upon those sort of ideas. So instead of the API where you hit the URL and just except whatever data coming back allows you to ask for specific kinds of data. This may be hard to see with the screen, but in this example, that is to well that or you can see that we have defined. \n",

      "2019-08-07 15:44:58   Is a way our data looks right as a project with the name of Tagline and contributors. Then you ask for what you want right? So this is the actual queries so instead of hitting an API just accepting data you say hey give me the project was the name of and return it that add okay and then the results come back with exactly what you asked for which is a object with project and rather than just a whole bunch of stuff maybe you ask work did not have to no decision to build three that you are going to use you allows for really excellent relational queries and I will show you what I mean here in a real environment in a second that allows you to well safe trips for instance, the YouTube API I keep going this one with the YouTube apI you hit it and you get a list of videos which is essentially the video I IDS but if you want all of the information about that particular video you have to then go back to the API and you have to oh yeah so okay I got this. Now that I have this idea pay you YouTube once more to tell me all of the information about this video when great you can do this an extremely relational queries that only make it. So you have to do one trip one trip for the API data comes back. Okay so is a query language is a way to get data from an API into your application. So to well, well, two actually a specification and the fact that graph was created by Facebook is one of those things I can worry people they can say well I do not I do not want to use some Facebook technology because of maybe Facebook reputation. Now now Facebook has some of the best engineers around and they have some amazing project. So I do not personally agree with that. But I understand it so if you know want to you. \n",

      "2019-08-07 15:46:58   Same the best part is that great is a specification is not an implementation as in you do not see an install graph Q anywhere on this site that is because you to use well you need to use an implementation of graph you up and one of the coolest things about it is that because it is just as stack there is compettion in the implementation space. So you are not stuck using Facebook projects and there is for a lot of interesting ideas not only that but you can use graph to well on any sort of platform. So if we went to the code part of this site you can see that of two parts right. There is the server component and there is the client component. Now if an a P i has a graph to server that already exist. You can just use that with only right? Well you need to learn the server side stuff but if you are building a full stack app such as level of tutorials you need a server library as well. So the call part l is that there is just all this choice. So you can see that we go to server libraries and there is categories where you can find to implementation and all of these different languages. And if I were to select Javascript. You can see that well we have some options too well that crack too. Well we have a follow server which is what I am using and all of these are great because again we i gives us options to use something let me explain a little bit while with the server actually the server essentially takes in your API you write your API as a series of type definitions. So you are defining the shape of your data and which is stuff like a query right? I think you the that is going to be in the results and then the server sort of takes all of that stuff in and exposes. \n",

Well would practical you hit one end point and then ask through the stuff you want. So we only have one particular end point which is typically, but you can actually set it to be anything you like and that is the graphical server right and allows you on any sort of server environment to be able to expose this information the possibility of and an implementation like Apollo is absolutely no notification having server libraries or implementation.

Youre be in our cloud hypotheses and and the session is all about giving days to you in five minutes and it is going to be a little bit of a challenge. So I am going have to brush over a lot of detailed concept. I want to give you a rough idea why is it and what it can actually view and what is responsible for the bottom. So there is a different architectural components too, which I going to talk about the first of which is the companies cluster services. \n",

      "2019-08-07 14:59:10   Really what that mean, I am going to see the cluster services is a specific configuration and it will be enough to the cluster services to go out and run that configuration in my infrastructure. One of the main components that I can what to call out is this a that in part of all this the API services so that is one global block of the system the second building block of the system is this thing called a worker and what is a worker or the marker is really just a container host the one thing unique about a worker were the container host environment is that it. That is this process that runs which is responsible for communicating with yes, you the cluster services and so this whole thing the cluster services. The workers themselves that is what makes up is customers. So let us talk about the use case here. So in this case what we want to do is feed this the configuration. So the desired state. So to speak is here in a deployments apple file. So here I am just going to call it application one. \n",

So maybe there is three four pod number one I can also list additional pause. So here is pod different color. So pod number two and I basically have container number three and then replica like a configuration file equal to two. So what happens. I will take this deployment file. I will print it to the API and it will be to the cost services to figure out how to schedule these pods in the environment and make sure that I have the right number of pause running. So I feed this file over here. Let is work on one so I am going to have one replica one pod one replica to replica three in addition I have also got a part team so here we are pod to replica one and in this case we have two replica or so let us just do someone replica to you and you you see at any point time the cluster services are responsible to make sure that configuration is running the across of my container host or or my workers. So what is what is the unique scenario that happen to what happens if I lose a worker. Now my running configuration because that pot is now dead my running configuration does not match this and it is after the cluster services through the template process and running to notify me of that and to understand what is actually running. So what I have done is I actually dropped this pod one replica to so therefore the schedule has to make a scheduling decision on where I need to extend that so you will just pick one of the workers loops. \n",

      "2019-08-07 15:05:09   So if one of the client changes something or make a update and saying they typing text or notify the it send it to the server the server processes of information and immediately push topics all the other clients and what is process does is that it there is actually a sort of delay right. So between the sending clients and the server and the server processing all of information we need to on the right will have to just sit there and wait normally like this is nothing issue it is probably only a second, but if there is a huge issue it comes down to voice chat or live streaming where one second can change a lot of things. So the of at was not so my client can actually directly communicate with each other and complete bypas the server. So this decreases the latency quite a lot because now it does not have to the receiving client does not have to wait for sending clients server in the server to yourself. So let us just will take a look at this and try to understand what this means right so normally on fine is really just a browser. It is issue out and it makes request to the server and is which response so that you can update itself and has a continually information. But what web you this changes fundamentally the browsers because now browsers can communicate each other server. So how to these clients even know about each other how they I know client is a connected to that you have not enjoyed ttle itself so that how it knows. So when we can get in example this is. \n",

This allows them to exchange files information any type of data. So looking at this right direct connection the browsers is it sort of sounds right like web socket for not really so the keyword here is direct can form sockets is what happens is there is a connection or communication between only the the client the server. There is a lot of things going on in between, but that is irrelevant right now if a client one something it makes a request in the server and this server response it says okay sure we connecting. Now if there are multiple of clients. The same things they may both plus server response of it and since it is a socket it looks more like that.

So this is sort of what happens behind the scenes first of course everything goes through the API so the developer interact with the API of the client and so users this API to set up the collection. There is identifying the client right. So how does the server knows this is defined and it is not just someone pertaining to be the client the name the ttle of data that is sending over is thing with voice check is it just from random files was that is over that there is math for universal. So not stand for network address generation and that alone can be a or five. So I will not I will not into basically what it is is the technique that establish a connection between the clients. It is currently used in pure and sharing and traffic and it transfers sort of like metadata data from the browser such as Browser our information ports and many more and there is is security. So is already sold like a security about this type of security about description. So when they does is being spent and cash web is are automatically chris any type data. So that way is someone working somehow how this experience in this transfer a data they will not be able to contain any initial resource information. Finally, it is so just determine how the data going to be compressed sounds so parts sounds great right. I allows communications direct communication. Why did we learn about sockets.

So these are the two powerful features which any search platform or a system has to offer. So offers are very powerful features of indexing the content to easily research on the docments or on the records and easily they treat those docments. So you guys have got about the famous guide the cutting who is the data of much more powerful framework are than losing even losing his being created by cutting so its very powerful. It is open source. Yeah, yep how do also been invented or creating by I think so it is a very powerful Java Library hundred focus source and purely Java is based on top of losing that is the reason why we are trying to understand what you is and in details will be getting into the much more absolutely in the part.

So these why you mean in that anything to make sure that efficiency of the data which is stored is easily easily the email most efficient and the fast way and without in getting scrutiny and a pool for like a full table you will be aiming up consuming more resources resources to coordinate those docments. So that is a primary reason of index content feel it can be optimized for speed and for easy driving so by in front. You can go and do a small look of kind of a into some sort can those docments technique do the way how the books are index stored all the phases or at the back of the page.

So before it gets stored into the index it has to the way how the docments has been is an excellent docment that is the very pure text docment. It has lot of cabbage text or copies characters. So all those alysis has to have to upfront because the docment cannot these two has is for connections and it has to be our first time to some sort of feeling communication before it can be submitted to the index. So the first step always is that process and once the alysis is done. So the docment itself again cannot be stored as is after the alysis and doing some sort of be possible. So the docments has to be and devoted into tokens or those so a docment can have safe right example can treat as definitely we can example, I can see it docment could be having lost of something like this about you so that. \n",

So while the docment is alyzed and convert into tokens or streams it then submitted to the process and the few. So is most of the time will in investing index need a structure model which will be covering it so so for we will just target it as these other the two key tests for the things of message which happens into the index flow so on the bottom right you may notice. If this is exactly what happens so once the docment or text is a alyze it is sent to the the list the stream of text into each word or those posts of the people use it automatically token or or whatever it is most probably we use is token or so once the token collaboration is done.

So while the docment is alyzed and convert into tokens or streams it then submitted to the process and the few. So is most of the time will in investing index need a structure model which will be covering it so so for we will just target it as these other the two key tests for the things of message which happens into the index flow so on the bottom right you may notice. If this is exactly what happens so once the docment or text is a alyze it is sent to the the list the stream of text into each word or those posts of the people use it automatically token or or whatever it is most probably we use is token or so once the token collaboration is done.

That is sources that can contain a lot of keywords did not necessarily mean that they were more relevant.

So this is sort of what happens behind the scenes first of course everything goes through the API so the developer interact with the API of the client and so users this API to set up the collection. There is identifying the client right. So how does the server knows this is defined and it is not just someone pertaining to be the client the name the ttle of data that is sending over is thing with voice check is it just from random files was that is over that there is math for universal. So not stand for network address generation and that alone can be a or five. So I will not I will not into basically what it is is the technique that establish a connection between the clients.

So these are the two powerful features which any search platform or a system has to offer. So offers are very powerful features of indexing the content to easily research on the docments or on the records and easily they treat those docments. So you guys have got about the famous guide the cutting who is the data of much more powerful framework are than losing even losing his being created by cutting so its very powerful. It is open source.

So you are not stuck using Facebook projects and there is for a lot of interesting ideas not only that but you can use graph to well on any sort of platform. So if we went to the code part of this site you can see that of two parts right. There is the server component and there is the client component. Now if an a P i has a graph to server that already exist. You can just use that with only right? Well you need to learn the server side stuff but if you are building a full stack app such as level of tutorials you need a server library as well. So the call part l is that there is just all this choice. So you can see that we go to server libraries and there is categories where you can find to implementation and all of these different languages. And if I were to select Javascript. You can see that well we have some options too well that crack too. Well we have a follow server which is what I am using and all of these are great because again we i gives us options to use something let me explain a little bit while with the server actually the server essentially takes in your API you write your API as a series of type definitions. So you are defining the shape of your data and which is stuff like a query right?

There is something that I be very was do not come a framework frameworks like Ruby or something that is too allows some invoices from kind of practices upon the developer and sort of expects the about the right code such that will only work well written in that order and to word away from the same words, you know specific in a workings and things will kind of make you words from the community around view also right. So especially when we work then like one of model and rails backend group on one of the biggest problems are things like handling database connections across different regions. You know using the appropriate data connection database connection or you only your master et cetera and you have to do a lot of to get that in where we go in have had to had chosen the right form of abstraction and design patterns that are put in place and will allow us to easily move with logic or handle much well the second thing was at least some other framework.\"\n",

Lot of things are pretty good things like in there are some inheritance which is when you are not a experience program or integrating them and understanding them understand things like you know solid principles etc takes a lot of time and takes a lot of experience for them to understand you know interface segments and cost principal etc. Then you should use a channel clas and you should do the parent clas cetera and that sometimes is not easily available. The clarify using composition over intelligence is very useful and the way goal does to is pretty nice that is very interesting the old font the language and does not have more than keywords. So this is very small language at its score. So there is useful and they also goes on explicit code right? So there were not things like lot of use of reflection at least every everywhere like would use an base programming like one would add in Java like frame. Basically next spring or where you use the like you use dependency injection to solve the dependency version and most of it was this random time dependency and spring is basically branded independently injection framework. So a lot of times I have seen there is a lot of complexity. I just how systems away and most of the time in go you just start provider it in the main you do not have to do a lot of the.\"\n",

So what one does is move create from interfaces around how your service interact the data database later we create the database active objects just the technical terms that people use so database access to sorry. Let is say for example and leaving with the so entty call meeting some of the common tasks that would expect to do with the would be to get a meeting by identifier to store the meeting object if I give it and two be able will do query meeting days on certain attributes if I need to which again, those interfaces. Sometimes can be very databases certain databases. Sometimes cannot this important for one to think about can I use a light while you store in general, but sometimes you might have to query by certain with different differently in narrow. You might want to have a initial index which table with an index on which is your one in base systems you can just maybe just create an directly understand table itself but that dollar consider the database how you optimized query inside the database should be separated from your service layer.

So to give an example, list like at least in the ruby, you would have a forward all models right and you put the meeting entty put the transcription entty you put like contextual core object like an entty detail into the same folder essentially and by doing so what is happening is within that photo people do not try to create tight between those entties.

I think so there is not a lot of communication request their reply and like use across the board so what we and and that a most scalable of approach is to use and even design pattern for system communication and handling to changes systems. So for that we need none the that all requests reply kind of items right or all that what we need is so we use that which is the system that we use for to support request like also that it the good thing about it is it does support responsive, but more importantly we use it for messages and aiming that is so what we should be doing for all internal communication. We should be using which is more reliable for sending for creating more events and having with and on them. What would be interesting is to create a small server system that would just subscribe all the topics and lax and you create an event log that one can just read from and you will create like it is on use the data for whatever you it needs to do like creating state back in case of.\",\n",

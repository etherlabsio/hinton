      "0\tWe're going to be talking about why is many people as possible should be learning sequel or stand structure through we language and it's the primary language responsible for managing data and data structures contained within relational database systems. So anytime you're trying to retrieve data from a database and data database or make any modifications the data structures you're probably going to using some there of the sequel or T language. Let's dig into the first reason why I believe you should our sequel first turn some great body the potential for somebody with strong seamless skills. That's pretty significant again if you're a financial a**lyst or anybody who who's excel guru but lacks the sequel knowledge learning sequel might be the next step for you to really progress your career and I get to find opportunity for a high job along with the higher potential see sought after skills by that are hiring this makes sense given the on a**lytics and the growth of data. So wouldn't apply as that are looking for more more individuals with have talent to a tree data on a database using sheet and know what to do with it along with the career audience and reasons for learning another reason that you might want want to see is because it enables you to get an answer to any questions that you have if you an inquisitive person and want to know as much as possible about your business. He enables you to think of those questions and then get an answer to those questions without having been g**l a bunch of different people trying to find the answers. If you're somebody works in excel how many times have you work the really big spreadsheet try to create some formula reviews some operation and excel crashes yes got better renewal but.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2\tBut happen he eliminate that crashing by writing a queries one building type those code or script and want to get again the database that system is designed to process millions a millions in millions of row very quickly it's designed from the efficient for a lot of queries are going what so if you're somebody who has to through excel crashing frequently because of volume more types of operations you try to deal with data sequel is going to enable you overcoming that and seem work efficient. The last reason we're going to talk about as to why you should are is that it enabled you to never have to ask yourself a question like how did I make that report again football queries to mean they can easily rerun at at any point in time. So if there's something that has many steps to it or is a little bit more complicated instead of having to redo all of your work. You can say that query want you to run it again you just simply alternate it up and execute it while there certainly some things that you can do within excel to be more efficient with your reports and are made certain things through media or power or something like that going to make that whole process much much easier so he going to to be incredibly efficient and not waste any time by the processes that can simply be opened up from your or included and while I you have your results. So wrapping up sequel because of a higher potential. It's one of the most in demand skills. It empower you to answer your own questions of your data, you will have to deal with excel crashing. If you write your queries and people got the database and won't have to read nearly as much manual effort that you can save your experience easily open and then where you run up at any time if you are interested learning people. We have a great course out there on online learning platforms. The course is called.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\tFor and it's a great course to get toes into learning sequel and we tried break it down and make it very, very simple. So I'll I include that link you can find it on our website very different places. So you out for that and you're interested learning highly recommend you take a look that that's it for that. Thanks again, the listening to today's eight three.\n",

      "\n",
      "6\tI also thought to myself that must be at must there and that means because if we take that information and we can turn into a picture when the join we in that right because when we draw but can they're trouble with that people say that's a great idea but I can't draw but I will believe everybody can draw something well to make the only november and today I tried to show you how to do we're going to start building up our visual with bursting that circle. So can get paper for that have a good.\n",

Now this time again have your page to port style and we're going to begin over here and the first thing we're going to do. It's a diamonds just draw that then we're saying what can they you into got to try long end now I'm going put a little by little face some bubbles that we are in the sense now connect the circle with the line the page number one now so lined up here call number two, we're going to do it circle again watch.\n",

      "13\tCouple the that way something different on the top and next frame this way that way got that. Let's go over this way three and you got so to the top. Now this floor align and then another line. Next we're going to go align in that way and now all sign and the other one applying that so we a and similar compliance. Then be a done. Let's draw number form. That's going to be a tribe next say what saying we could that into hmmm what sure we take it here it looks fine both with another at a little nine on.\n",

She needs to constantly growing because her company continues to launch new products and customers are consuming more of their services. This increase of services has caused some challenges for the tools that you use to investor of these servers or not as effective would use to as much larger volume servers. This challenge affects how do coded deploy in her production environment usually with new employees release. It takes a little production take to the production environment. This is why requires code deployments to be scheduled and are only allowed one a month.

      "2019-07-02 11:27:54   Were going to be talking about why is many people as possible should be learning sequel or stand structure through we language and it is the primary language responsible for managing data and data structures contained within relational database systems. So anytime you are trying to retrieve data from a database and data database or make any modifications the data structures you are probably going to using some there of the sequel or T language. Let is dig into the first reason why I believe you should our sequel first turn some great body the potential for somebody with strong seamless skills. That is pretty significant again if you are a financial alyst or anybody who who is excel guru but lacks the sequel knowledge learning sequel might be the next step for you to really progress your career and I get to find opportunity for a high job along with the higher potential see sought after skills by that are hiring this makes sense given the on alytics and the growth of data. So would not apply as that are looking for more more individuals with have talent to a tree data on a database using sheet and know what to do with it along with the career audience and reasons for learning another reason that you might want want to see is because it enables you to get an answer to any questions that you have if you an inquisitive person and want to know as much as possible about your business. He enables you to think of those questions and then get an answer to those questions without having been gl a bunch of different people trying to find the answers. If you are somebody works in excel how many times have you work the really big spreadsheet try to create some formula reviews some operation and excel crashes yes got better renewal but. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:31:54   For and it is a great course to get toes into learning sequel and we tried break it down and make it very, very simple. So I will I include that link you can find it on our website very different places. So you out for that and you are interested learning highly recommend you take a look that that is it for that. Thanks again, the listening to today is eight three. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:32:21   On your understand the compiling processed and Java. Let is first take a quick look, but sometimes vice would be because what I is defined was the subtle I be all the clients. I think just working visibility right. Sometimes turn the pipe try it in my mind and just on mind. I could not remember start. I stopped then it we got near to be termination how I thought to myself I am never gonna to remember any things. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:33:25   I also thought to myself that must be at must there and that means because if we take that information and we can turn into a picture when the join we in that right because when we draw but can they are trouble with that people say that is a great idea but I cannot draw but I will believe everybody can draw something well to make the only november and today I tried to show you how to do we are going to start building up our visual with bursting that circle. So can get paper for that have a good. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:34:05   Can pay for this way around like the are we going to start by join so like that. \n",

      "2019-07-02 11:34:15   What I I need to do draw to more circles and made eyes then those and ni. \n",

      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:34:35   This time looking in this way and the knows and this time let us still a different expression circle which we can shave in and we got a expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:34:52   I want to just stand here another circle. Next time the but looking and then what if you like you might be safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:35:11   Powerful expression so that is our first site our to get a circle call everything we can to is going to be is easy that so just turn it and we are going to build up it short two. Now this time again have your page to port style and we are going to begin over here and the first thing we are going to do. It is a diamonds just draw that then we are saying what can they you into got to try long end now I am going put a little by little face some bubbles that we are in the sense now connect the circle with the line the page number one now so lined up here call number two, we are going to do it circle again watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:36:15   Couple the that way something different on the top and next frame this way that way got that. Let is go over this way three and you got so to the top. Now this floor align and then another line. Next we are going to go align in that way and now all sign and the other one applying that so we a and similar compliance. Then be a done. Let is draw number form. That is going to be a tribe next say what saying we could that into hmmm what sure we take it here it looks fine both with another at a little nine on. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-02 11:29:54   But happen he eliminate that crashing by writing a queries one building type those code or script and want to get again the database that system is designed to process millions a millions in millions of row very quickly it is designed from the efficient for a lot of queries are going what so if you are somebody who has to through excel crashing frequently because of volume more types of operations you try to deal with data sequel is going to enable you overcoming that and seem work efficient. The last reason we are going to talk about as to why you should are is that it enabled you to never have to ask yourself a question like how did I make that report again football queries to mean they can easily rerun at at any point in time. So if there is something that has many steps to it or is a little bit more complicated instead of having to redo all of your work. You can say that query want you to run it again you just simply alternate it up and execute it while there certainly some things that you can do within excel to be more efficient with your reports and are made certain things through media or power or something like that going to make that whole process much much easier so he going to to be incredibly efficient and not waste any time by the processes that can simply be opened up from your or included and while I you have your results. So wrapping up sequel because of a higher potential. It is one of the most in demand skills. It empower you to answer your own questions of your data, you will have to deal with excel crashing. If you write your queries and people got the database and will not have to read nearly as much manual effort that you can save your experience easily open and then where you run up at any time if you are interested learning people. We have a great course out there on online learning platforms. The course is called. \n",

       "\" Okay. It's. All the changes accomplished complete on Subscription on two things I noticed test was that I IP address in the main link. So for that we I'll discuss and and. Very and so that that won't happen and will that for the we need the then function that website video only allen. And then we be kind of whatever they there is something for. But I saying so at so that they know that it's it's if we can all ask for okay have app. Yeah, right right? Right? Yeah yeah. Okay? I'll do that okay. So that is one I think that's it right anyone else think of anything else before we just upload it and make it ready. Are those are okay only. Yeah, sorry, the only thing to be is is that we don't in that and the myself the old spaces. I don't know if that will cause a problem or not I of okay. What will do for is when make all the changes in that site you know website ether larger Io today and then we'll ask Colin do take one quick pa*s and then if everything works. Well more go life. Okay. So one more thing is you do. Right and then on the slack page I our to kind of with info and update update that so that be fairly straightforward. We go wanted the stopper pending yes. We look like the so. Sorry, I missed the last one so that. Okay Yeah, we can get a basic side. Sorry which one sorry. This one the recording phase, but this is let's check right very final in production like. After that mean. I like on higher party I can do that okay no I think. Should I just remove that b**ton from website and in in the moment if the it is better. Alright. Recently like weird yeah okay so like. And as for few weeks like few changes which were basically stored on database. So it would be easier to directly like flush the data database of production and deploy that staging two database on production so that would lead to like you had created a trial account in dot dot. So that would just of that try now. Admin page right now it is just the basic so what the Colin had pointed out was that if we can make it look like the ether dashboard page in the background and and all that yeah. So I will work under like a log missing today and I work on auto beta sorry. I work on auto data and then building it for windows. Finally he had confirmed this was well like according page. This is test and the production okay so then you can go ahead. I for we to nine and before to hours to connect space. I'm just plugging out the user that we r raised. Now it'll be March today. Okay. Okay. So that I'm thinking of the. Sounds good okay. I guess we can't really pro until we got this upgrade problem right? Yeah yeah got got it. Okay yeah we to take care on that okay sounds good so yeah, just stay focused on that once that is done then we remove to this yeah and. I'll Login like we have a. Sorry that has been by one. From there is they see a new release correct correct yeah. This one okay regarding the team. Like branding name changes is done and in your of apps we they by the deep and only remaining parties to I have to make it sign. It's getting the left right now correct correct right let's be. Yeah okay I'm regarding that. Okay We'll check i mean this must be like a ownership issue right? Yeah so what will take is if. And other guys. Customer markets yeah so. Four and all so with so tested staging and let the play back. Right we talked about the hopefully this call will be able to test and everybody hands up when you see that that we have fixed for that or not. Yeah I think a. In this were moving all the New recordings so. Get it done by today so that we can be deploy tomorrow and okay. Want we are done with this we dont need to do know create for each customer. This is just a double shed. Right? So in this case Factor example. Denied so now it was but. Just to make sure that you know the right things are you know the right in the API well. Anything else my. An an open issue enabling it or any solution code. You know essential, but the either i. Working fine so and the peer is also the. I think this is really the last one last really critical one before we go right right? Yeah. Yes yes. Looks like what happened it looks like I was let's say based know like Microsoft or. Check to properly is in the placing. That left as part of this you know. On centralized how even the customer flow is also fine yeah. Yesterday yesterday I think if you saw that do you and I've saw when a suddenly got us session expired. And also this. To google the space in. Tested these things. Yeah I didn't see. Okay So that is one. One by one so there might. So there's my issue. When after the Speaker changes. After the okay. A platform the I. I think you're extending. He. Pending also have used okay. So can do it enough. That's that. With switching theory should help it on. Launch issues because so there was a issue so I it a issue. They might need someone to test. Not. Yes for this I it's the ether podcast if if. Right? I evening anything else. Different transactions. I need to like it will be easier for to deploy the ether staging to the site staging two database on live on production. So all that changes which Colin on Friday could otherwise to manually do those changes on production of so I noticed that he had a dial account on the production. So it's fine. If we just remove that. One time taking one of add by. Involved. Yeah i. Some reason looking multiple just use. We last time day we have this results on the for one time meeting we have you and India hasn't shared it that but we have the results after from sharing them. We are trying to resolve yesterday on how to resolve that and then and then separate on. So the five and that will have. That could one strategy to use it only for long calls. Yeah they. There is a. Might right? Yes you. Do the multiple. Joining actually some our package there is. With the code for that so there is some in the ways package is that they are using. Instead of this that we don't know. But. Okay. With call. So once. Alright, let's go on to zero. All three communities so that we should we should address that before we I start in the label with this other otherwise eleven to and differentiate the top is that direct all last week whether are we have this topic change that we manually good right updates on something it has that at that time has changed and topic which is really incorrect, but we just need to take it forward what to handle out the because perfect. Okay that's interesting and and then on the last one word I'm meeting right? I'm I'm working on it wherein. We will have instead using both the to support that deep. So I have I have just I have that word we did not update that's the final but that still good but I'm just back when good tool put that into staging do so that as well that we can do any enhancement or that that later. There are lot of lot of things that we think I there is a long call and if there's only one single speaker you have to take and also. Deep you all this in. He said the was actually license with the new line where and when once it got to the server backend. I just twenty days error. So if we directly improve it our one internal, but if we can go through the gateway there problem. So what will do we check know they it right and if you want we can know what do are thinking is in core the string to be sixty four and it and the server side I should be you know. What I thinking about is if really like there's will be a couple of things right like one is getting a basic getting a website up. I think is good like we should stop just find a way to just update it we should remove the links to I download and Mac desktop top and windows download from now right the start windows. We can some over we can add it's done and we brought it with the view all that also on the emails we send we send today just send download you know what view that that email we send we say you start ether hope you can do with it and we also say go ahead and download the I and Desktop apps maybe at least I until those are approved and available maybe we should change that come sooner or something like that right okay so that's why you tell everything anything those are just need to be done for only this week until everything has come together yeah so should I add a coming soon. Sounds good yeah. So I guess if you need to hang up at the same time right. Takes very like logic Wherein expires is after seven days. So like we need to change it to experience after seven days of log the user logs and the most will so right something like ready. I think we should be able to that by today and then have this going. So I think we've got our last couple of days we should resolve it today on the training. Okay such not god.\""

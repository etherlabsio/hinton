So now we're to talk about users interface design what one are the responsibilities of UI designer how do you learn it. It's a good career all those kind things we're have tough out right now we're user experience design us all about user experiencing the product and having a label interaction with it user interface design is visual cousin on speak it's all a look feel and the interaction and the presentation of the product itself. It's something might be saying doesn't that help me have a better user experience yes, it does that's why there's across from Gray, but Ui is more closely related to the visual communication arts like graphic design has been picking colors and or you making things really be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at for u UI the responsibilities that you'll find there are more related to design to web design to maybe even branding sign and also time front and development because having a good understanding of code design.

If you're near a large city if you're not in your large city that there's plenty resources online. I would think even more resources to learn I design design and visual design. Then there actually is for something such user experience fine. So I would look at find those resources that I'll link a bunch of like favor resources down the description. So you guys can find those and use those what about getting a job in the space of the UI designer can you do something like that absolutely log them great jobs especially in the tech industry for great user interface designer. I would say that the pay is with your experience are selling like job application but if you're new to the whole thing you might be able to get an internal and that maybe like junior designer position and then move your way up and with different experiences kind of get yourself working in the industry if you're transition over from like web design or even more traditional print or design you might want to take a few courses and do a little bit of up studying on the best practices of user interface design and spend some time owning that crap because it is very very different. Although we use a below of those basics client principles which I just love and think are just the investing in so as long important basic design principles.

      "But we hard to include that so like that go.\n",
      "So yeah issue i. I think difficult go by if you go by the way your training couple obligations should not have any should have should not have any any negative impact feature.\n",
      "So if so data data is in our time so we can always drop that if we take that coming keep.\n",
      "Yeah yeah I do think so yeah, because that will help us our one application steps really to better is.\n",

      "--------------cluster 1------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "I think this is extended it is weird case that is okay I am am just trying to think of corner cases what happens if there is what happens is if there is a like a twenty minute possible that file after the call after after two the end of the call and then everyone everyone just hung up.\n",
      "That is that is what we so you check there is it if it is not available you you the features okay just in case if it if it has missed because of any of this calls start yeah, I yeah, or do you think that is of facing this problem to some extent.\n",
      "If you get multiple small segments before time Lambda would be more and then the second segment when it comes in the first number is still add so it group write info at new numbers always now yeah.\n",

      "That is also like like Karthik call that you mentioned where you were on call for two to hours there is a file more than like twenty minutes what happens.\n",
      "But the thing is I like before deploying the production also once tested with four or five long that and but it never gave that call so okay that it current is so yesterday yesterday.\n",
      "Yeah that is I saying that is I use universal symptoms code we are label and data that means if you guys then if we have to put the complete flow in perspective we have an article with five five paragraphs.\n",
      "Know they should not be again for last step but also zoom that you already got those segments before so you got those segments before then you.\n",
      "Yeah and even U S. It just does naive lead application so that could also help us that I mean we see how there else third idea okay yeah all the way is basically.\n",
      "Transcript also enter phase service as ad segments and so basically are their feature vectors are computer and stored and then after all five or top ten google this after that they send extra keepers.\n",
      "I did for all the books and Okay went up four reports which is what was recommend it and I has get all of the models and I saw that as you train more it got order.\n",
      "It should not be that much of an issue not I am am missing out some other thing each other which is like an important thing which we need to consider but it seems as you do that.\n",
      "Yeah we can go ahead for a fight you task this but to use it in like production I do not think so cause by majority of the of software are a lot of vehicle tags.\n",
      "That is so you wondering what the properties of the date does it not exactly the context in sense that is.\n",
      "I do not Dunno if if it is is what is the ether effect of that does that as again.\n",
      "So I use making them wait a queue would be in our head of and then if there but by so it is it is so I think need.\n",
      "Have a response spend well so you are not the problem is it because you have five minutes of time to do everything and then it could spill our only at times.\n",
      "We not avoid it and mean what can we do with those kind of situation and that is why should should we should accept calls set as part of our so let us means instead of trying to.\n",
      "Maybe these are all clear theoretical other observation that we made and then and then once we see that happening.\n",
      "Somehow I think we have got with because I could even compare it with the was really bad like unbearable to good.\n",
      "We talk to that could that would actually make your data a little more and then and then conversions would be slow, but still you you your model be like.\n",
      "Or sorry got it how much current ten and then if you have any basis at least at least a of time plus something so he.\n",
      "So on so the reason why this Google comparison the respect to tags was just to check whether the onboarding space is actually that will like if we get some I people from all the medium data we have and their tags.\n",
      "Yeah have they are trying to learn on that or which the label data that good come from the two centers some quarters.\n",
      "Then then fine it will will wait we need not GPU or or our we just try tuning on the same approach.\n",
      "Friday was I just extracted all the dads from the medium articles and then just comparison by club all these segments in group content is comparing it will do what three process tax for that particular group.\n",
      "About it what takes and then and then if you do not know if you want to replace an P that work.\n",
      "Yeah that is true because we are not I that vector application seems to perform any other that people come up with so yeah.\n",
      "Yeah usually at the the the event call life is right the latest the latest being the pm.\n",
      "They get this and almost like fifteen to twenty nine one.\n",
      "If it is not really if there an silence at the end of the call we just need to the the things would be delayed that is it.\n",
      "So till this service is doing like it is trying like first time second time or time till then they already send segments.\n",
      "Yeah so that is it line with the paper as well so yeah got.\n",
      "Even if we increase into one minute this would happen only like one and sixteen times right yeah, so yeah, still getting the but but Monday.\n",
      "The same thing you can do it on so yeah that should be possible.\n",
      "I do not think you is different it is case i anything usually.\n",
      "No that is not if that is fine then if you get two segments like from different meetings.\n",
      "But only I just not yeah but only only only reason to have GPS to just have a comparison with like okay.\n",
      "We and all I am saying is they just learn the context if okay if you say if there is a better way better.\n",
      "Let is do I think the reason is getting good to us on U s because of the application over all the two kids.\n",
      "Have trigger that is also he just delay the team is a little bit.\n",
      "A kind of handles, but it also creates problem because okay right say suppose for first time we spoke a lot and we for the fifth chapter.\n",
      "--------------cluster 2------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "That is that is highly possible actually so if we have two before meetings you just have have got the created meeting to your service and then you just one and then suddenly you get a second meeting before ground already in book.\n",
      "In mobile I just thought if I have some set of that I can just and them with current media text and then put it into s three with the feature at us and then download it at the end of the meeting just compare it with the groups and then send it okay.\n",
      "So that will so that this will basically can help us do like a small p o where we can see if right i just use it for key service with like okay will send me feature records for segment and key phrases and this comments all will read will basically get that request and load graph and populate and do all those things.\n",
      "Yeah, but do not you think that should be for the for the processing of of this kind of like call it arrays condition or not but you have a here right.\n",
      "Okay But then but so you saying if we have some three what happens so so for every new meeting starter you are are actually you found working and at Lambda again, that is a problem right.\n",
      "It is wordpress video so the currently is yeah, that is the prototype the correct one as well because this D seems to just segregated but we just you would want to do that after you gather the context from a medium data.\n",
      "Your condition right as soon as the meeting gets started there is always a transcript that there is a very response segment when that can come within the next two seconds and you do not have Lambda is not in that a bad way of doing the.\n",
      "Okay So also Karthik by telling that get so if was the problem is it is it something that you can put it in some two line trillions for us to understand that.\n",
      "I do not know, but but but at least for I think I still can come in but at least for the day paragraph with this he s paragraph versus a key if not as good as sentence and code and it is actually comparable.\n",
      "I mean yeah I do not know whether this the case but these are two cases that I do not know whether we should handle it or whether we can find a worker on for this.\n",
      "The Transcription trigger only have the end of the call correct correct so it will will add up to one more one more one more unit time or lambda tomorrow just trying to understand it.\n",
      "If there is already one run you then yeah, if I call again, the lambda then basically to start a new lambda.\n",
      "So right now I have our onboarding tool that which are separate like in the and around the seven and hundred and ninety tags which to video.\n",
      "Okay So yeah, but let us up for the five clases how that how that so it is still we five clases you still store.\n",
      "So it or we can also test it like like multiple calls per everything just to me.\n",
      "I just told him that we should if if we taking time to conclude this we should that only have all the models in staging two.\n",
      "Yeah so we just increase the a time of seconds so forty seconds the only once in a meeting we would actually reach that point that the service and is in course start.\n",
      "That that would work one if the true set of clas which we give that is the from the article and the tags.\n",
      "Let is say blockchain you yeah, like the tags of engineering the latest shows the most number of times to be this.\n",
      "But this came all service right the GPU is not and not at as good as sentence code for the key phase to parallel comparison.\n",
      "And that could be that should be, but you do not aggregate there you will just take the last token feature director okay.\n",
      "Yeah that is decent enough and more when you see things like Doc and kubernetes you see around zero point six point seven and between the is are around point.\n",
      "So if you appearing you can to text streams and this one how how did you compute that only one network enough for this.\n",
      "From the so so ideally the process supposed to be that when I get meeting started so that time I do not get any request to anything.\n",
      "So if the universal sentence and encoder for a word like go will give you the same feature vector for no matter what it is whether it is the board game go the language code to go.\n",
      "So set lambda there to be environment and active every time you get the request but one.\n",
      "But if we do not know it is I think it is I think it is practically for us to learn the context by by giving the anurag and then this sentence this token.\n",
      "Oh two seconds more than the ten certain marker, but theoretically it can go beyond on that test right that is very rare actually call yes.\n",
      "So I was able to run these steps and I could figure out even as the paper they mentioned that the feature space club together because of the training and initial for steps and I against the features piece.\n",
      "So we need to sure that couple application does it that.\n",
      "So it has to let go through every segment to get key phases and you if if some of these segments are not priced then it has to get director and as.\n",
      "It is not a clas such it is the golden and score from one to five that.\n",
      "So we have like a around fourteen fourteen thousand of fifteen thousand which is impossible to compute clarity that is why we are talking.\n",
      "Yeah so like for a segment I sent that segment text and what candidate get.\n",
      "Just that much compliance just take a group which has multiple statements combined them and then take what by.\n",
      "I think we should be able to see that happening in in this meeting.\n",
      "So the idea is like anyway right now I am using this for population index so later like.\n",
      "Right the right number the problem is like we do not have any approximation going on.\n",
      "As in for, but we are aggregate total level and whereas as for P aggregate is the last sentence for so.\n",
      "--------------cluster 3------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "So this this goes and checks that these segment ideas are not part of the graph and then it will start feature extracting and putting everything into graph and then giving the key phrases so that whole time sometimes crosses ten seconds.\n",
      "So it is just downloading the graph file and the clearing for the feature that top five results and then the transcription would still be so it transcription still happens.\n",
      "Only asociate the one take universal sentence quarter decades paragraph and then Associate only the more similar tag and then use that does not have as a label data that you find you for the for the support path.\n",
      "So we can perhaps server paragraph for a sentence attach to tag and then compare with the sentences feature vector that would make more sense and even GDP can be used that way instead of taken the tag feature vector cause models are indicated as well.\n",
      "Accepting or F default the N L I D. It does set does it really help much with that because it is based on the soft backs plus for sentences which are while yeah is directly related to and similarity.\n",
      "So if it works for this for this service then we can use we can extend to payments size well.\n",
      "So it is like seven Lambda calls great feature at store in the graph and all those things then query for feature.\n",
      "If the create an exception which does not in includes so.\n",
      "Whereas in G. It sort of blue is called text over the tokens and there is only an aggregate context of the and at so perhaps we can try the vector of traction method that I came up with last week.\n",
      "--------------cluster 4------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "Yeah, I guess we should there is also the point of stability at the paragraph level right.\n",
      "So all if I added but but but if we should be able to accommodate this immediate request without without leaving it right.\n",
      "--------------cluster 5------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "The footage this the learn parameters completely, but S status of just one only is able to separate the vector into you know relevant and non relevant sentences.\n",
      "You can call it at the instance start, but it should be way to accommodate the request that comes like within within the WAL of time and bomb name is at seconds.\n",
      "--------------cluster 6------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "So this ad segment if they come immediately and if we are we still not connected to Lambda then basically it is all non processed.\n",
      "Meetings it so happens at Lambda does connection does not as establish the first second do itself.\n",
      "--------------cluster 7------------ \n",
      " \n",
      "The second one create Lambda service would still first.\n",

When that well runs dry, what are you supposed to do?.  strategically applying smart HR insights into different areas of the business tends to improve employee engagement throughout the company. However, identifying the right strategies to market your business is often likened to rocket science.  Some businesses have been built solely on the backs of social media. How do you get your message to the right audience and do it effectively? How do you boost visibility and increase sales while sustaining a profit with a converting offer? Today, with so much vying for our attention from social media, to search engine optimization, blogging and pay-per-click advertising, it's easy to see why most are ready to pull their hair out.The truth is that what got you to this point in business is likely not going to get you to the next level. If you're feeling stuck, join the fray. Most entrepreneurs are so busy working 'in' their businesses that they fail to work 'on' their businesses. As a result of dealing with the day-to-day operations of a company that includes customer hand-holding, supply-chain demands and more, we often neglect to wield the right marketing strategies that will help fuel our business's growth.\"\n",

There is something that I be very was do not come a framework frameworks like Ruby or something that is too allows some invoices from kind of practices upon the developer and sort of expects the about the right code such that will only work well written in that order and to word away from the same words, you know specific in a workings and things will kind of make you words from the community around view also right. So especially when we work then like one of model and rails backend group on one of the biggest problems are things like handling database connections across different regions. You know using the appropriate data connection database connection or you only your master et cetera and you have to do a lot of to get that in where we go in have had to had chosen the right form of abstraction and design patterns that are put in place and will allow us to easily move with logic or handle much well the second thing was at least some other framework.\"\n",

So so with respect to that the problem with Java the one of the two main part Java of was types so when you had to great clases and yet to create interfaces. We have to say this clas implemented interface and make sure that you try to not try to get in exactly the dependency place and worry about those things and unless the clas does not provide implement interface even though it has all the messages. It does not work out definitely at that point time was somewhat shaky if the Java had been introduced because not as efficient as go she was or not easy to manage the way go had done with respect to go things in the way managers in admin manner scale was interesting because it is a functional program language for the problem was there were just not easy for developers to get onboard with and the bigger problem was that it had a functional.\"\n",

Lot of things are pretty good things like in there are some inheritance which is when you are not a experience program or integrating them and understanding them understand things like you know solid principles etc takes a lot of time and takes a lot of experience for them to understand you know interface segments and cost principal etc. Then you should use a channel clas and you should do the parent clas cetera and that sometimes is not easily available.

So this is very small language at its score. So there is useful and they also goes on explicit code right? So there were not things like lot of use of reflection at least every everywhere like would use an base programming like one would add in Java like frame.

So to give an example, list like at least in the ruby, you would have a forward all models right and you put the meeting entty put the transcription entty you put like contextual core object like an entty detail into the same folder essentially and by doing so what is happening is within that photo people do not try to create tight between those entties. This is really the is this one and there. It is easier to paint the relations to things.\"\n",

Now because there there can be sometimes dependency that client is is support, but we just will not be able to figure how to bring this now right? So one thing that is important is figure out okay what entty should be isolated from what we are the entties and what were like higher level entties high deposit that need to talk to lower levels systems there to common an operation. So in my mind I try to think of it as zero one to services where zero means complete we operate on the input. They do not talk to anything else tier one basically auto to one or two loud mobile less. Well will we talked to lower and zero or one different. So so he try to buy different systems based and me from what environments. It is important to move systems around to pay to the bottom case much as possible. So that they are more reusable but sometimes it is not possible. So to give an example, there are far system where in our company that want to build the platform right our core l related services are t zero and they to operate like a zero or at to some extent one service depending talk to some other services, but they should never go beyond that so because we want high the usability of those things. So we try to figure out okay we want a contextual score you want a keyword factor we have maybe transcription engine. We have use service and we have some other services that know other service in the same level should in the same can talk to only service in the same level but not.\"\n",

What is the next transcription for meeting right you would try to go get the current meeting based ID that the servers will do get the meeting object and then it might talk to some other service also to get some more information, then it will pas it down to the business package the meeting or domain layer here here are the data that has gathered for you go come to the next transition that you need to make and give me all the data that you will generate for me to work on operate on those phones.

I think so there is not a lot of communication request their reply and like use across the board so what we and and that a most scalable of approach is to use and even design pattern for system communication and handling to changes systems. So for that we need none the that all requests reply kind of items right or all that what we need is so we use that which is the system that we use for to support request like also that it the good thing about it is it does support responsive, but more importantly we use it for messages and aiming that is so what we should be doing for all internal communication. We should be using which is more reliable for sending for creating more events and having with and on them. What would be interesting is to create a small server system that would just subscribe all the topics and lax and you create an event log that one can just read from and you will create like it is on use the data for whatever you it needs to do like creating state back in case of.\",\n",

Youll mute to that so I as soon as we finish like this I was to see alright and like I guess I was going to like the have a meeting good like front end meeting. So like we will we are going to discuss about this in that. Like started to like restart her like we had the end interface. So like we have to start like actually implementing it right because that is provider the prism is then we can like change on this right. Maybe we can do it tomorrow cause we have a yeah is good when we get maybe after fancy when this integration are we reducing the polling that we do for markers and. Your cases as more like case with the connection was like the last time you could miss some events during weight connect. I mean jobs are very less, but maybe we can discuss that separately maybe I think during the connect may internally the right revenue to deploy if. Same we uploading like if it is a playback or a live call or like whatever first time we not pulling like calling the get right. Thank yeah so maybe end of this week we can see yeah part any other update from let us integration perspective on the side. There are different in the Node version that we use as opposed to I think we would be higher. It is working actually pretty well and even link it is quite instantaneous. So when we pause the recording and asume it it is almost done. Yeah. But it is a big task for any payment one case okay even on I O S sitting that done with the socket right? So we can be ready on both of. It is Ios I tried in production also once so it was working that is socket working fine. I been pushed in open. Facing like the electron users bit divided does not consult properly and like yesterday it was so and was was like or we cannot compile the load files and we need a appropriate order for that. Got it right? So and you supporting during the holding the markers as the first time we join yeah for. Then like Gypsy say was trying mile so comparing with that and trying doing like we the same our electron. In all areas like the I am getting now we went slides like particular packages. We can can okay so I can. Yeah I had like, but know they have supported on Friday like I had to fix it like I anything some other context five like you had noted but after that I did not get to. Which working on we need to and same.\n",

      " Got got so should we increase it and this what generally happened during the first chapter calling right i am I mean yeah other getting properly. Okay. I really because I done my be multiple lambda better something like so right there would be for things right if you dont. Forty seconds, we just integrate two seconds that would work for this case but then meetings things are happening. I think we not already. That is running not necessarily currently but there is some overlap like two the functioning on the flow even as that say for example, let us say the first meeting call exact places and it occupied the lambda maybe to the call start right the next one within two seconds of the extract app. We have to upgrade the second one trigger that should ideally force a new lambda to trigger that like call start to occur. Before be concurrent so the first one before call from the first meeting would be ten seconds maybe before the second all of which view would be doing. Busy Lambda in this case is like true to keep the not more than the extraction mostly. Got it okay so then maybe we just increase the context and Linux succeeded for extracting for now and then deploy the production. Okay. No no no even will my before if the Lambda was not is Lambda already occupied some would trigger multiple a scheduled will do if the payment case service for example, if you were calling completely even if you call and currently and extraction. There would be ten around. So you see well right? So which means that it is not like they are gonna go exactly the same second end of down. That is some like extent and that is what and that is. You cannot predict when meetings like two maybe start at the same time and they can be tickets back within two to five second in sense and you still end up creating multiple numbers. In this would I can cause the call because he first meeting one trigger calls lambda and the second meeting could still use the force around. Correct then and the second one when is the next happen comes in if the first for any of the it will lambda was is the second call meeting it would end up creating a new whole start. I mean so any point in types. Yeah that is true. So when it requires. Yeah you have this seconds of call start then then it would trigger the.\n",

      " We can show like a of gravity fitting which will be like on base the basis of if they belong to same team ID or if they work part of same meeting for and number of times or something like. So let us say for example when the extract key process of this we give you all the transfer segments and you do keep a track of all the segments people as spoken and the extra extract key phrases at least for the grouping of the segment that we give that is not asigned to all the users and say right because you do not know how spoke that time yeah yeah got so we get an idea of team level set of ether graph okay. So what is it proposal maybe be we can go instead doing a user level. We can say, okay aggregate right my context and try to figure out the. Right? If you want to show some kind of user connections then we can show it in when we see that if Karthik was part of this particular context say first next number of time and on the user was also in this context like similar frequently of with similar frequency than maybe they both could be interested in each other. Got it? Yeah that will be good what about the topic markers that we extract at least we do not actually we do not them extract any insightful information out of it right. So if we had none that we actually figure out okay these people have updated so many topic market and do people like the same so. Finally the idea is this so there should be separated out from key phase and then it should be like offline or separate running task, which after the meeting and gather all these elements spoken by this week user and operators key phrases for that user. So we which will be like us user keywords are spoken work spoken by this user and set of and then these set of cases is should can be combined with tags the keen touch sure yeah that that that is way we can connect to multiple users. So otherwise we will have like possibilities of connections. You have to aggregate then it will become so these key are most of the time they are already descriptive ones. So they will not make that. What about team level interests because by an nature. We already have a lot of team that interests using across meetings or across part identify okay. These two teams share the same interest end they to talk to like users. Yeah, we can show that so my team email you mean.\n",

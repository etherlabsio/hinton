      "There is a stack of different options for example, Azure which even as they are very to and stored and encrypted your most sensitive animation and then can point in just like you was hearing or not selling that Json in fact it will look at multiple locations and based on your priority will select those highest one that finds so how you are absent such chase on your local development but then have your Azure override that in production even or staging.\n",
      "So that is where can it is a little up here input those things like fonts they were growing in the root folder because our static files so kind clean of it break it down to a stand what is going out of we got three folders controller models views makes a little more sense.\n",
      "So now let us actually look at what the code behind controllers look like the control is how runs an application here is our full framework controller pretty standard of course it pretty much empty well let us go to our controller and dot it also looks pretty standard in fact the differences are minor we still average view initial main thing and then agreeing the new need to match that thing some privacy I you because we had a privacy method.\n",
      "So is pretty much the same thing as our full framework about their about down views about okay so they can show it with almost of the same the code is fairly similar.\n",
      "Okay nowadays all on there is such a thing as face designer for things like copies side of Airplane and you know all that kind of stuff but as closely is know used in under the stuff now like websites and products, but you is to receive.\n",
      "Next we have a three four controllers models and views which we have models and views as well, but thing has our spurs things as well, for example content fonts scripts and of course that is the playback.\n",
      "Well this is what I aiming for how does that understand itself day day we do we month a month and that is where something like the schedule can be unbelievable is a Google calendar.\n",
      "They recommend for things like and connections strings and I connections strings reason they give three of now for it went the huge healthy control the web server but something they can consider well with core applications.\n",
      "So it is the same concept you have to better name as a better group as well okay we come down to core we have you we do not have a that down here in a full framework.\n",
      "You know those are that is what life is about and if you do not have any of those things well you have got left is and suffering.\n",
      "So there is not a lot changes as far as you can jump breaking it down net core and most stuff is just gonna work the same way that is a deal now let us look add a layout page.\n",
      "For example, if attention or database going here possibly but and this is where a S p dot met he socket at core in general had takes a next level compared to the full framework.\n",

      "So if you are not going study here you are not going to practice on all that then you should do a model functions right or one case you talk five and all that but that is when our fake aset because how they make more blood just like with the going by all the money but reason register for money is number one experience the text to the three parts of outcomes.\n",
      "It is something might be saying does not that help me have a better user experience yes, it does that is why there is across from Gray, but Ui is more closely related to the visual communication arts like graphic design has been picking colors and or you making things really be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at for u UI the responsibilities that you will find there are more related to design to web design to maybe even branding sign and also time front and development because having a good understanding of code design.\n",
      "Let me make this even simpler a uX designer is going pas on skeleton and the UI designer is going to put on the scan closed and direct that knife people responsibility does use entire and the biggest sprint is the look and feel of the product the UI designer will do a good compettive alysis of what is going on in that same market what is like the standard what is a good look and field join a design research to make sure that the product makes sense like the designer is not a children application of making a look like a for walk, then designer just gonna to do all of the graph additional design for project.\n",
      "It is a good career all those kind things we are have tough out right now we are user experience design us all about user experiencing the product and having a label interaction with it user interface design is visual cousin on speak it is all a look feel and the interaction and the presentation of the product itself.\n",
      "I would say that the pay is with your experience are selling like job application but if you are new to the whole thing you might be able to get an internal and that maybe like junior designer position and then move your way up and with different experiences kind of get yourself working in the industry if you are transition over from like web design or even more traditional print or design you might want to take a few courses and do a little bit of up studying on the best practices of user interface design and spend some time owning that crap because it is very very different.\n",
      "So whether there websites being viewed on a desktop for mobile device or maybe an cost three have to look good in all of those different aspects and then also the designer you is responsible for interacting was developer and making sure that things look and feel and all work the way that they should this report to development and the UX and the UI team all kind of come together and they making sure everything that is supposed to be every step way a UI designer.\n",
      "Yeah, because they can print them why would you say that why would should work for it as faster you can work for it and number two think you drop an experience go to that.\n",
      "Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I will work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes.\n",
      "Things and so it is that that and beyond thing need to make sure that feedback beyond mobile of site absolutely expressed what that beyond is all about taking any brand any a company and the UI designer role to make sure that that is expressed through the interface itself.\n",
      "Query language announced as or sometimes that sequel is actually the standard language for dealing with relational databases can be effectively used to insert search update and delete database records that does mean to cannot do thanks beyond that in fact it and optimizing and maintenance of databases and much more relational databases like my ask q more Ms Q Sai et cetera use ask sent taxes used in these databases are almost similar except the fact that some databases use different in taxes and even proprietary as to outs and taxes an example of an statement select start from members where age is greater than thirty stands for database management system.\n",
      "I hope that helps to kind of differentiate and makes sense of the two and hopefully help you out if you are looking into the two fields figure out which ones right for you.\n",
      "So you guys can find those and use those what about getting a job in the space of the UI designer can you do something like that absolutely log them great jobs especially in the tech industry for great user interface designer.\n",

      "Crash purchasing power all going down people working higher and harder the central banks on the well, printing more money and so someone listening to us and stuck in that poor middle clas trap and they hear is their fear that ultimately is keeping that that is hard thing to hear but you are going to give the information about what they can do if they can get out of that well every time I can I go lot speaking into the maps so leave another invite me because we are gone but I know what you know it is so what you are saying is what I think was best.\n",
      "So that is why I we are talking about it a use people are article of my cherry question and he explains how the and putting pay taxes and built some numbers at on different order could not understand and because up our school that would reach you that three types of and they joined him and say wrong and it is changing and we see it over over again, Amazon not paying taxes or you say people when call say rubber from there and knocking architect well there is all the three sites to our point and I will head tail in the edge from side of the for my side, but this everybody can do the same thing for everyone other then will want the task only for the now tax loss whatever everybody can to have the like financial and the reason I am been financial education.\n",
      "I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there is a bit responsibility that is going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you are going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you are not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that is a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it is like sorry, that is just not a good strategy.\n",
      "And that is hard for people because they do not like themselves very much they are always like back in the web and then procrastinating and cracking the way them procrastinating against like so such a way is spending your time and you know what that is like because you probably wait like six hours a day what you do now is going to it is in the future.\n",
      "That is the first thing that people do wrong is well I do not like how all let us schedules was like what kind of schedule are you are setting up well I have to do this.\n",
      "So and you need to know what you damn is worth one of the things you should be asking yourself is would you spend an hour with this all have I paid someone fifty bucks to have had that hour an answer is no, it is like well mean you should do something else with your time and depends on whether I can that your time were not for but the funny thing about not asuming that is if you asume your find in while what happens is you do not just sit around randomly in the stage of responsibility with less when we do is to operate eventually and consult that seems like a statement solution.\n",
      "Most of the guys is complaining they do not know those kinds of and the do not have jobs anyway they have asets and for the average small on poor guy something could not school they do not btons.\n",
      "So if you your yourself back and forty which is real easy because that is just matter of not doing as well that he dont know when you fail and people might say well I really do not want to know when I think because that is painful so I will keep myself lined about when I fail that is fine except you fail all the time then you just will not know it until you failed that that you got and that can easily happen by the time you are forty so I would recommend that you do not let that happen.\n",
      "So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it is more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what is the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him.\n",

      "So you known like you chose us not to okay so once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this like looks like that might be worth than having despite the fact that it is going to be you know exciting promote and threatening and there is going to be some suffering and loss involved at all of that obviously the goal is have a vision for your life such that all things considered not just advise your efforts.\n",
      "I was is true every you can do it but most people just do not do it sometimes like said they do not have the education you need to have a plan if you are going to go through things well that is not risky.\n",

So it is the same concept you have to better name as a better group as well okay we come down to core we have you we do not have a that down here in a full framework. This data route. If will restore our static files things like our CSS Javascript is even static html pages can go in here we have that kind of thing that our application. So for example, this the icon for our website live inside route, but down here it is right in the the main folder. It is a little difference a little bit more separation that understanding how what those. \n",

So that is where can it is a little up here input those things like fonts they were growing in the root folder because our static files so kind clean of it break it down to a stand what is going out of we got three folders controller models views makes a little more sense. I think. \n",

      "2019-07-04 12:27:27   So far. It is just been cosmetic changes the dependencies. Weve moved to that things others rooms. But we are not to get some more concrete detail here a minute for example, we have app not Json. This is where we store all of our configurations. For example, if attention or database going here possibly but and this is where a S p dot met he socket at core in general had takes a next level compared to the full framework. This is just one type of configuration option for dot Corp in fact, it is not the configuration option. They recommend for things like and connections strings and I connections strings reason they give three of now for it went the huge healthy control the web server but something they can consider well with core applications. There is a stack of different options for example, Azure which even as they are very to and stored and encrypted your most sensitive animation and then can point in just like you was hearing or not selling that Json in fact it will look at multiple locations and based on your priority will select those highest one that finds so how you are absent such chase on your local development but then have your Azure override that in production even or staging. So the next level also this is JSon very easy to write. \n",

      "\n",
      "2019-07-04 12:30:23   So now let us actually look at what the code behind controllers look like the control is how runs an application here is our full framework controller pretty standard of course it pretty much empty well let us go to our controller and dot it also looks pretty standard in fact the differences are minor we still average view initial main thing and then agreeing the new need to match that thing some privacy I you because we had a privacy method. So is pretty much the same thing as our full framework about their about down views about okay so they can show it with almost of the same the code is fairly similar. \n",

So that is that is a bad that is a bad deal for you so number specify by your because how are going hit something if you do not know what it is is that is not going to happen and often be specify their goal too because they do not like to specify conditions for failure. So if you your yourself back and forty which is real easy because that is just matter of not doing as well that he dont know when you fail and people might say well I really do not want to know when I think because that is painful so I will keep myself lined about when I fail that is fine except you fail all the time then you just will not know it until you failed that that you got and that can easily happen by the time you are forty so I would recommend that you do not let that happen. So you known like you chose us not to okay so once you get your goal structure set up you think okay if I can have this like looks like that might be worth than having despite the fact that it is going to be you know exciting promote and threatening and there is going to be some suffering and loss involved at all of that obviously the goal is have a vision for your life such that all things considered not just advise your efforts. Okay you do then they he turn down to the micro it is like okay? Well this is what I aiming for how does that understand itself day day we do we month a month and that is where something like the schedule can be unbelievable is a Google calendar. It is like native day schedule and stick to it. Okay so what is the rule with the schedule. It is not a bloody presence. That is the first thing that people do wrong is well I do not like how all let us schedules was like what kind of schedule are you are setting up well I have to do this. Then I have to do this and I have to do this you know and then I just go play video because we wants to do all these things that I have to do like said schedule. So that you have. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-04 12:21:49   There you want that is the trick it is like okay I got tomorrow if I was going to set up so the best possible day. I could have practically speaking what would it look like or then you schedule that and obviously there is a bit responsibility that is going to go along with that because if you have any sense one a things that you are going to insist upon is that at the end of the day you are not worst shape than you were then at the beginning of the day right and that is a stupid day if you have a bunch of those in are row you just need yourself and then you for yourself and it is like sorry, that is just not a good strategy. It is bad. So maybe twenty percent of your media has to be responsibility in obligation or maybe it is more than that depending on how far behind you are but even that you can ask yourself okay well they thought these responsibilities have settle in the damn and what is the right ratio of responsibility to more and and you can ask yourself that just like you go sharing with someone who is working for him. So I want you to work tomorrow and you might say okay? Well what are you going to do for me that makes it like and then I will work for you all you can ask yourself that you know maybe do an hour of of this visibility and then you play in for fifty minutes. I do not know whatever turns your playing, but you you have to negotiate with yourself and not yourself like you are negotiating with someone that you care that you would like to be productive and have a good life and that is how you make the schedule it is like and then you think well if I have that day that I would be good great you know and you are useless and so you are probably only hit it with about seventy percent accuracy, but that beast the of zero right and if you had it even a fifty percent accuracy another rule as well in person one percent the next week or fifty and a half percent for God because you are going to hit that position where things start to loop back positively and buyer so that for that you been working on your country plan life you would like to have. \n",

      "2019-07-04 12:23:49   And you do that by referring to social norms that is more less you your father from the value of the way, but the way the other are way you do that is how a conversation with yourself about if you do not really know who you are are because you know what you are like you will not do you are told you will not do what you tell yourself to do you must have noticed that it is like you are a bad employee and a worse loss and going into those for you you do not know what you want to do and then when you tell yourself what do you do not do it anyway but you know my point that you have to understand that you are not your own servant. So to speak someone that you have to negotiate with and you someone that you want to present the opportunity of having a those life too. And that is hard for people because they do not like themselves very much they are always like back in the web and then procrastinating and cracking the way them procrastinating against like so such a way is spending your time and you know what that is like because you probably wait like six hours a day what you do now is going to it is in the future. So and you need to know what you damn is worth one of the things you should be asking yourself is would you spend an hour with this all have I paid someone fifty bucks to have had that hour an answer is no, it is like well mean you should do something else with your time and depends on whether I can that your time were not for but the funny thing about not asuming that is if you asume your find in while what happens is you do not just sit around randomly in the stage of responsibility with less when we do is to operate eventually and consult that seems like a statement solution. \n",

Alright chris so let us give an call this person we want hear one three. Now depends on your time and your experience your location. So maybe do a little bit of research on that because I just cannot give you the best answer for now for you specifically okay. So now we are to talk about users interface design what one are the responsibilities of UI designer how do you learn it. It is a good career all those kind things we are have tough out right now we are user experience design us all about user experiencing the product and having a label interaction with it user interface design is visual cousin on speak it is all a look feel and the interaction and the presentation of the product itself. It is something might be saying does not that help me have a better user experience yes, it does that is why there is across from Gray, but Ui is more closely related to the visual communication arts like graphic design has been picking colors and or you making things really be beautiful and aesthetically pleasing if you look at for u UI the responsibilities that you will find there are more related to design to web design to maybe even branding sign and also time front and development because having a good understanding of code design. Okay nowadays all on there is such a thing as face designer for things like copies side of Airplane and you know all that kind of stuff but as closely is know used in under the stuff now like websites and products, but you is to receive. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-04 12:42:03   All of the needs and the structure and everything that somebody like to use your experience designer has done and then take that and put that into in attractive aesthetically pleasing platform to be received by users. Let me make this even simpler a uX designer is going pas on skeleton and the UI designer is going to put on the scan closed and direct that knife people responsibility does use entire and the biggest sprint is the look and feel of the product the UI designer will do a good compettive alysis of what is going on in that same market what is like the standard what is a good look and field join a design research to make sure that the product makes sense like the designer is not a children application of making a look like a for walk, then designer just gonna to do all of the graph additional design for project. If they interface for like an application or website. Were talking colored or fee. Were talking btons and interactions with all that kind of visual stuff nowadays standard for you runners to also be thinking about animation interactions to the a UI designer also their design in every screen site our illusion. So whether there websites being viewed on a desktop for mobile device or maybe an cost three have to look good in all of those different aspects and then also the designer you is responsible for interacting was developer and making sure that things look and feel and all work the way that they should this report to development and the UX and the UI team all kind of come together and they making sure everything that is supposed to be every step way a UI designer. It is not necessarily a branding designer. Although they are closely tied to the brand of a company of product and they need to implement that brand through the design of the. \n",
      "\n",
      "2019-07-04 12:44:03   Things and so it is that that and beyond thing need to make sure that feedback beyond mobile of site absolutely expressed what that beyond is all about taking any brand any a company and the UI designer role to make sure that that is expressed through the interface itself. So how do you learn you either design and is a good paying job and where get jobs that similar to us design. There is probably some great boot camps in your area. If you are near a large city if you are not in your large city that there is plenty resources online. I would think even more resources to learn I design design and visual design. Then there actually is for something such user experience fine. So I would look at find those resources that I will link a bunch of like favor resources down the description. So you guys can find those and use those what about getting a job in the space of the UI designer can you do something like that absolutely log them great jobs especially in the tech industry for great user interface designer. I would say that the pay is with your experience are selling like job application but if you are new to the whole thing you might be able to get an internal and that maybe like junior designer position and then move your way up and with different experiences kind of get yourself working in the industry if you are transition over from like web design or even more traditional print or design you might want to take a few courses and do a little bit of up studying on the best practices of user interface design and spend some time owning that crap because it is very very different. Although we use a below of those basics client principles which I just love and think are just the investing in so as long important basic design principles. You can kind of transition them over to you either. So there is the difference thing between you and UX design some overlap a little bit of similarities, but very very different. What of that being more than more alytical the other one being more visual problem solving seventy driven. \n",

I thought this was necessary for the kinds of apps I was working on. And with that in mind, I tried many approaches and frameworks for implementing the same pattern: Single-page applications (SPA). The next thing we shall do is get the necessary credentials from GCP. Go to the GCP console menu and select APIs & Services then Credentials. Now click the Create Credentials button and choose Service Account Key. On the next screen choose Compute Engine default service account and JSON then click Create. This will download a json file to your computer, move this file to the folder where we shall write our terraform code.

But in order to get more visibility, businesses have to spend more money. When that well runs dry, what are you supposed to do?.  strategically applying smart HR insights into different areas of the business tends to improve employee engagement throughout the company. However, identifying the right strategies to market your business is often likened to rocket science.  Some businesses have been built solely on the backs of social media. How do you get your message to the right audience and do it effectively? How do you boost visibility and increase sales while sustaining a profit with a converting offer? Today, with so much vying for our attention from social media, to search engine optimization, blogging and pay-per-click advertising, it's easy to see why most are ready to pull their hair out.The truth is that what got you to this point in business is likely not going to get you to the next level. If you're feeling stuck, join the fray. Most entrepreneurs are so busy working 'in' their businesses that they fail to work 'on' their businesses. As a result of dealing with the day-to-day operations of a company that includes customer hand-holding, supply-chain demands and more, we often neglect to wield the right marketing strategies that will help fuel our business's growth.\"\n",

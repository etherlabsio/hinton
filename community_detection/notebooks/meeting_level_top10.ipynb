Now what is the database we already know what data is, but this data can be random a database is a systemic collection of data since the data in a database is organized it makes data management easy. What is a database management system database management system or t m is a collection of programs, which enables its users to access a database data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let is discuss a few examples an online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data and pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a D to manage billing client related issues to handle fault data cetera.

They start out with all kinds of hands on and then we turn it into higher and then think off the design to a working prototype time a working prototype type this tested been sounds pretty fine right or those both the and the interaction designer are able to figure out watching the app and one that they test and way the design to get just to perfect.

So I spent about two leaks trying to see if I could figure out under what condition. So I could do that I what kind of a psychological of transformation. I would down down the role to be able to do that and so that was a exercise that say and it only took about ten days for me to realize. \n",

There is something that I be very was do not come a framework frameworks like Ruby or something that is too allows some invoices from kind of practices upon the developer and sort of expects the about the right code such that will only work well written in that order and to word away from the same words, you know specific in a workings and things will kind of make you words from the community around view also right. So especially when we work then like one of model and rails backend group on one of the biggest problems are things like handling database connections across different regions. You know using the appropriate data connection database connection or you only your master et cetera and you have to do a lot of to get that in where we go in have had to had chosen the right form of abstraction and design patterns that are put in place and will allow us to easily move with logic or handle much well the second thing was at least some other framework.\"\n",

I ideally like that a lot but again I because it to the list of the foundation of the language is very small. There is not a lot of things that learn about the language to go work. Yeah, but that because also that it is list most people uncomfortable, especially because when we started it. We need people with media processing background. These will go at work especially on lower level systems and plus plus with handling network related itself are heavily comfortable of as a language and to train them do not just learn like how to write high level software was one concern that Wouldve happen regardless of what language. We choose but on top of that piece then my whole different paradigm.

The clarify using composition over intelligence is very useful and the way goal does to is pretty nice that is very interesting the old font the language and does not have more than keywords.

But this is metrics do you want to do some logging maybe be some so of several that it is where you put it. But you can have some user that a pattern as you want would stay where you pas the data interface how what the methods essentially this service should be doing on the piece of code like a meeting server should be doing and you wrap the same implementation of a logging system of the metrics publishing system and you ask them in words and the most thing would be the core so is that actually does the work. So so that is one level middle based the business or the service later then you back up to perform to think Singapore. Okay now dial dealing with how my system interact with other systems in the company and how it performs. What it needs to the status are the business requirements. Now how now is to now let us worry about how systems communicate with each other right. So then transfer put it layer and work. Now in that that you have to worry about okay, how will I transfer information between two services also.\"\n",

Let is say for example and leaving with the so entty call meeting some of the common tasks that would expect to do with the would be to get a meeting by identifier to store the meeting object if I give it and two be able will do query meeting days on certain attributes if I need to which again, those interfaces. Sometimes can be very databases certain databases. Sometimes cannot this important for one to think about can I use a light while you store in general, but sometimes you might have to query by certain with different differently in narrow. You might want to have a initial index which table with an index on which is your one in base systems you can just maybe just create an directly understand table itself but that dollar consider the database how you optimized query inside the database should be separated from your service layer.

So to give an example, list like at least in the ruby, you would have a forward all models right and you put the meeting entty put the transcription entty you put like contextual core object like an entty detail into the same folder essentially and by doing so what is happening is within that photo people do not try to create tight between those entties.

What we do based on the results that you get and even though and can even go down to the latest. So that is also part the domain driven design. Now definitely one of the problems are I was call it all but some of the challenges with building something like a or the system that we built right now is transactions are extremely heard distributed transactions pretty hard is we can just supply ID acquire a database lock or a transaction log with an excellent. We can just do a computer role, but if you want to do which given the nature of the system that we are building is it does not require that amount of consistency just just we lucky in that manner, but in some place you been my so we end up having to create another layer of sections or things you tag up bton and like that where you want to have a some an might use and responsibilities, but they operate on the events. The system generates try to tie different services to get the and tries to hold information and generate new right for the track on and form that kind so they of old okay I need the talk a meeting service creating.\",\n",

I think so there is not a lot of communication request their reply and like use across the board so what we and and that a most scalable of approach is to use and even design pattern for system communication and handling to changes systems. So for that we need none the that all requests reply kind of items right or all that what we need is so we use that which is the system that we use for to support request like also that it the good thing about it is it does support responsive, but more importantly we use it for messages and aiming that is so what we should be doing for all internal communication. We should be using which is more reliable for sending for creating more events and having with and on them. What would be interesting is to create a small server system that would just subscribe all the topics and lax and you create an event log that one can just read from and you will create like it is on use the data for whatever you it needs to do like creating state back in case of.\",\n",

They research that wire user tests the list goes on and off if you're new to the game this can all feel very overwhelming well throw that here out the window because we're about to embark on a journey through the sixteenth end of the UX design process that before starting any successful uX project you'll need to be in tune with two things your user in your brain. I start with the user big question around this is what problems are they making once you can identify the problem, then you can begin to start working to towards the solution second is understanding the brain and how does the project you're are working on aligned with the branch mission and goal to summarize in this stage you wanna identify the problems facing the users as well as the core goals of the brand and see how they along as a designer you probably have a gun of a*sumptions about what the user wants or doesn't want but not challenging those a*sumptions channel. If you want to hold that's two people dig yourself out on one on one interviews focus groups surveys and usability ask few methods to how bet your a*sumptions base them on real tangible evidence and keep mind you don't need a survey a million users a good rule of thumb is finding three to five users in your target audience they'll save you time and typically give you as much data as you need to move forward with your project. Now that you've done your research you can take all our data and start working with it one way to lay out your research visually as with a user persona. So as will act as a guy when it comes to making all of your design to say if you ever get stuck you can always look back to the Brazil to figure out the users need and if you need a wider view of the big picture journey that your users take try a user journey app creating a user journey map can help you understand what the users will be going through when they interact with your product or.\",\n",

It's time for another round of a**lysis, but this time you wanna to ask yourself in your team questions like where did our process go right where did we struggle how are losers responding to the product. Then we solve their issues and angles with a solid amount of reflection you'll gain in valuable knowledge that you can leverage to make sure future projects run even more stable and that brings us to the end of our journey.

But when you hear people talk about Twitter's API or Google's API, but they're talking about is a rest API the rest API stands for representational State transfer now, it doesn't have to be the case. But usually a rest API works pretty much the same way a website. Does you make a call from a client to a server and you get data back over the HTTP protocol? I think one of the best ways to show the many similarities between the rest API call and loading it on the web page can be found with Facebook's graph API. For example, let's pull up YouTube space be WWF facebook.com slash YouTube. We're all familiar with what a Facebook page looks like shows how many likes the YouTube page has things like that. But now let's change the www depart to graph got facebook.com slash YouTube and what we get back is a response to our API requests. We've made an API request in our browser to Facebook Graph API.But we get back might appear to be gibberish to the human eye, but it's actually JavaScript object notation or Json formatted data. It's structured data organized. According to key value pairs same way an Excel spreadsheet is structured key value pairs in my task for the data that's in sell a 16.

       " 'originalText': \"Ux Designers have a a lot on their plate. They research that wire user tests the list goes on and off if you're new to the game this can all feel very overwhelming well throw that here out the window because we're about to embark on a journey through the sixteenth end of the UX design process that before starting any successful uX project you'll need to be in tune with two things your user in your brain. I start with the user big question around this is what problems are they making once you can identify the problem, then you can begin to start working to towards the solution second is understanding the brain and how does the project you're are working on aligned with the branch mission and goal to summarize in this stage you wanna identify the problems facing the users as well as the core goals of the brand and see how they along as a designer you probably have a gun of a*sumptions about what the user wants or doesn't want but not challenging those a*sumptions channel. If you want to hold that's two people dig yourself out on one on one interviews focus groups surveys and usability ask few methods to how bet your a*sumptions base them on real tangible evidence and keep mind you don't need a survey a million users a good rule of thumb is finding three to five users in your target audience they'll save you time and typically give you as much data as you need to move forward with your project. Now that you've done your research you can take all our data and start working with it one way to lay out your research visually as with a user persona. So as will act as a guy when it comes to making all of your design to say if you ever get stuck you can always look back to the Brazil to figure out the users need and if you need a wider view of the big picture journey that your users take try a user journey app creating a user journey map can help you understand what the users will be going through when they interact with your product or.\",\n",

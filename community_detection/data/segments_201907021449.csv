I find that this is a great summary. So you are talking about services that you would use for hosting your own web page. For example, because your only weapon made up of PHP code node code HTML things like that. This is all code that needs to be executed. The HTML code actually just needs to the service to clients to be execute a third if you're generating at all, the server, let's say with a framework like Mary welcomed me to run code in order to generate that HTML. So things like that can be done with services and the compute section endlessly. C2 is one of the most eminent services offered by yes, and it essentially allows you to spin up your own server for to be precise your own incense on the computer. So you spend a computer in the club and you're not limited to hosting websites there you can do anything.Run your personal strengths. You don't need to connect it to the internet. In fact actually by default. It's not as opposed to the Internet. So you can use that to run any code you want in the cloud on your own computer. So to say and you can configure it to be as powerful as you need it to be now. If you're thinking of trading a gaming PC there that will be a bit tougher because obviously it's just a server to which you connect through the terminal you got no desktop will monitor connection. But again, you can do whatever you want on that. So Amazon ec2 is a very important Service as allows you to run your code in the cloud. Of course one prominent use case is to turn this into a web server open it up to the Internet install a server like Apache and nginx and run your PHP code or run your no fart things like that.

So we'll look at a couple books a pre-civil couple. It's just going to stall some the passion and the movie server, then would be Jaden's the already testing that cookbook. So we're going to install Docker on our Jenkins agent and then we're going to send a test kitchen in that Docker container so we can test and in this cases that we do 1804 when a testing environment that we're going to play it on tape so we can test in this small environment. So Jenkins is going to spin that up for us to do it and then Jenkins will at once it pass all of its inspect tests. Jacob will end up up push that to Chef server and it'll tell them whether it's a you need to converge because there's something a professor over that you need to go get and that last one just says we're gonna grate, you know, Chef Jenkins Docker into our. A continuous on a pipeline which is very human-like. So this is kind of a bigger picture with you would use Jenkins work or anything you could put on there and then this is workstation usually have to do one action, which is get push. That's okay Dad gets mad but you really should just do it get pushed up to GitHub. It should then trigger Jenkins to download that code automatically. Once it does that you can do all sorts of things. You can launch Test Kitchen, which is where I'm going to show you now, but you definitely have to download Java code and run some like neither and retrieval and create jar files and more files for you. And then as you take those jar file or files and push them up to a Jay Park drift car factory or S3 or anyplace else you want. If you have you can also have a Docker file so you can generate your own Docker images of what you created from the cocoa and then Jenkins can build the images and push those to our Factory or Amazon's elastic container."", ""transcriptId"": ""5d2b9982-e886-4a69-9b0b-9dca5f82918b""}",2019-07-02 13:26:40,2019-07-02 13:26:40,,false,"5d2b9982-e886-4a69-9b0b-9dca5f82918b"

So for easy to wear a traditional server you pay all the time you pay for the outside basically for random, you only pay for the execution and this of course is a very nice way. This is actually a very trendy way of building applications where you have the defense driven approach where you pay for what you use and where you only executes the code when you meet you executed so where you don't have any idle time on a server behind the scenes of course is still uses a server where it's basically loads your code and runs and when required but you don't have to manage the server. You don't have to manage any capacities. You just put your coat there at as or execute when you were event triggers.

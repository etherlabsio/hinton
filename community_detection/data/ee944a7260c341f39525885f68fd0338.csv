And iPod is like the smallest unit of deployment in kubernetes in terms of the kubernetes object model. And what it means is that in a pot. I can have running containers and you can have one or more. So in order to run that pot I need to specify some sort of container image. Maybe I would have to container images and further down the line. There's other things like what TCP port and we're Services running or what not. But the other additional thing is that I'm going to specify how many of these pods need to be running here. So maybe there's three four pod. Number one. I can also lists additional pots. So here's pod color. So pod number two and I basically have container image number three and then replicas. I'll make a big Eurasian file equal to 2. So what happens is I will take this deployment file. I will feed it to the API and it will without building up to the cluster services to figure out how to schedule these pods in the environment and make sure that I have the right number of PODS running. So I think this file over here let's work on pot one. So I'm going to have one replica one pod one replica to pod one. Replica 3 in addition. I also got a pain to so here we are pod to replica one. In this case. We only have two replicas here. So let's just do pain one replica to here. And so you can see any point in time. The cluster services are responsible to make sure that configuration is running across all of my container host work for my workers. So what is what do unique scenario that happens your what happens if I lose a worker?. Now my running configuration because that part is now dead my running configuration does not match this and it's up to the kubernetes cluster Services through the cumulate processes running to notify me of that and to understand what's actually running. So what I've done is I actually dropped this pod one replica to so therefore the scheduler has to make a scheduling decision on where I need to instantiate that so it will just pick one of the workers.

Well, you're on the right video its most basic form. What books are nothing more than HTTP messages that are sent usually responds to some event from a third party service that you're using. They're also sometimes used to describe pre-built API endpoints you can use to send down to web Hooks and apis are so closely related that sometimes what books are called reverse apis because they saw a very important problem with apis for apis the user like you and I will request data from an API and the API will give a response a common use case for web hooks that when you're interested in data changes. So imagine you're running an application that uses the GitHub API and you're requesting information about the commits for a given project program location is you want to perform some action. Once there's a new commit on that project getting that data from getting that's not very hard to Simply use their API and then you get a list of all the commits for a given project. So in this case, you could record the hash of the last commit and then just run it over and over and over and over again and just keep checking to see if that has changes if it does change then, you know, there's a new commit and then your application.Fond as it should there's a couple problems doing it this way. Number one is complete waste of bandwidth and server resources and but number two and this is more important is that GitHub has a cap on the number of API requests you can do. So now enter the world of web hooks where you can just tell git Hub when there's a new commit send a message in this way is no extra bandwidth moisture API calls and there's no limits are going to hit. So I'm using this web of tests or service which gives me a URL to send my response to one thing you do need is a place to send the web to so in my case is just the tester so I can simply go to settings for my repo go to web hooks. I can add a new web hook. You can paste that with book test URL I can say give it to me in Json navel is sell send me the whole push event at a web hook and we're done so you can set the hook is created. We sent a pink payload. So come on over to our tester. We see that we did get one post request from GitHub with a little phrase here in the Bookshop. So I'll just delete these so now we're going to do now is just make a commit on this on this test Rico I have so I'll just do event you'll see when I push this and go.

So if I go would just redo it is three push you'll see a new one shows up here. I can click that and I get that new commitment and the information that you get in the web hooks going to be scrubbed ahead time by the vendor that you're using. So in this case GitHub will tell you that in the web hook. We're going to send you, you know, all this stuff commits and hashes dates and whatever else they want to send but it is for say like a credit card processor. Maybe they would send you a web hook for a new charge which contain you know, how much the charge was who made the charge and so on remember I said, there's a second type of web hook where it's a prebuilt kind of pre-built API endpoint and you can use that to send data to own example, that is Discord with hooks. Usually when Services play nice with one another you're able to send web hosting one service to another to attain some new functionality on the other service. So imagine I wanted to post in my Discord server every time there was a commitment to a project on get home. This would be really easy to do when you're going to Discord under the Web book section and create a web hook I can say where I want to post it and then I can take this URL for the web code and I can. I would then take that URL and I would put it to get out so I can add a new web hook I can use my Discord URL Discord wants you to put GitHub at the end that way they know it's from GitHub and they can do something Fancy with it set up creation. Json. Send me everything at what book we're all set some of my with excreted. I have a connection between GitHub and Discord and I can now make a commit. So I'll do a commit message like really hope this makes it to Discord and I can do a push. I want to push succeeds. You can see if I'm over here get home at one new commit really hope this makes into this court. Keep in mind. It's not always this easy to integrate to Services together. The reason this works is because this court has already looked at GitHub webhook format and said if you put slash GitHub at the end of the whip hook link to sort will be able to parse that message and it makes something nice on your server any service that you use that has an API is most likely going to implement at least some web Hooks and that's because there's always going to be data that they using these subscribe to oftentimes the data you get from a web Hook is the.

So right here below. I'm going to create the project now. Once that is ready. You will have normal repository. So there's nothing excited. So the first thing that we'll do is create a new file and this file will be called that it lab - see I dot e mo. So this is how the file should be made and this is a convention it will automatically recognize it. So what we're trying to do here is to create two basic stages. There will be a build stage and there will be a passage way to build stage. I will do something very simple and create a file and then enter test age our test at that file was actually created previously. So pretty pretty basic now in order to get something to run you need to Define some those steps. So we're going to define the stages how they are calling it lemon, so I'm going to say something like stages.And then with the tab, I'm going to say there's a bill stage. And there is a test. Each of these are the stages the two stages that we have and now we have to define the jobs themselves. So we're going to have a build and you can Define it as you want to rename it as you want, but it's important not to say that the state is built."", ""transcriptId"": ""16824657-1958-4bac-8797-8ec0964344f1""}",2019-06-17T08:35:07.527Z,2019-06-17T08:35:07.527Z,,false,16824657-1958-4bac-8797-8ec0964344f1

Where is artifacts should be located and only artifact that we are interested in are inside build folder. So this should probably be enough to publish those artifacts. So let's give me those changes again and see now if the pipeline is successful. You can also easily see the pipelines that are currently running. If you go on this left foul on click on the ICD pipelines, you will see now that this current time that is running its on the first stage and still it's a bit to complete but soon it will get to the second stage at that should probably be successful and now I just refresh the page and sort of both stages are successful and let's go into the test want to see exactly what happened there and you'll see that this command has been displayed here testing attend to test itself that this file exists has worked as well and you'll see here the effect that this artifact are be downloaded and this makes this entire pipe Network. Now, this is a very very simple pipeline but as you can see you can build upon it and you can really get into more complicated.

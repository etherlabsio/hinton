The two types of literature reviews found in journals are research articles such as studies and surveys and Standalone literature analyses. They differ in their scope length and specific purpose the literature review found at the beginning of a journal article is used to introduce the research related to the Pacific study and is found in the introduction section usually near the end. It is shorter than Standalone reviews because it must limit its scope to very specific studies theories that are directly relevant to this study.

Thanks for joining us this week. I'm going to give you three of my top tips for chipping far more consistently. I'm also nervous gasp. Maybe some of the pitfalls. I see a lot of my clients. I never you insane bracket. Maybe you're hitting the ground a little bit behind the ball on the horrible thin sure that there were rows on the ground goes too far. We're going to sketch some reasons why that's happening. So my very first tip is around set of what do you need to do with the setup to increase the likelihood that you're going to strike every time the first thing is to realize that the setup is very different to the way you tell it to a normal shot. We're not were shot. We want to generate power. So the shaft angle in a normal shot is much flatter and because we want to create Rod session back and through one of my power but in chipping look we don't need power so we can take advantage of that fact and and how we take advantage of that is by getting you to skip the shaft angle far more vertical. What does it. It is a shaft angle is more vertical as opposed to shallow. We can get that club working straight back and straight through on a more pendulum selection and therefore is far more accurate. So that's a very first thing I want to do is start to get the club in a more vertical vertical position. The next thing we do send up a little taller and when you let your arms hang then that you're going to hang the probably because you'll be a lot closer to it now, but probably hang naturally a lot lower down the group's that's a very first thing I always do is clinical shaft angle and stand a little bit taller when they're going to point our toes slightly from the ball. Okay, and we're going to lower our left shoulder. So the from this angle so from here, we'll Central toes point from the golf ball Sterling here directly in line with the ball and I'm going to stand nice and tall and I'm going to lower my left shoulder. Why would I know my left shoulder this is something that a lot of people miss the get all them bits, right, but they get.

You often need to go back and check the literature while reformulating your ideas. This means you will not be writing a literature review at any one time but constantly working on it before during and after your study is complete. This process will apply more to stand alone literature reviews, but can also be useful in understanding what to include to introduce your study. The first step is to choose a topic to write on focus and explore this topic choose a topic that you are familiar with and highly interested in analyzing a topic your intended readers and researchers will find interesting and useful and a topic that is current well established in the field and about which there has been sufficient research conducted for a review. This will help you find The Sweet Spot for what to focus on in a journal article introduction. This is the point where you might realize you need to adjust your scope depending on what you learned from the literature next research and collect all of the scholarly information on that topic that might be pertinent to your study scholarly.Books academic conference speeches dissertations and Theses and any other academic work related to your area of study is called the literature next analyze the network of information that extends or response to the major works in your area area select the material that is most useful you thought maps and charts to identify intersections in the research into outline important categories select the material that will be most useful for you to leave you following this it's time to describe and Summarize each article provide the essential information of the article that pertains to your study determine two to three important Concepts depending on the length of your article that are discussed in the literature take notes about all of the important aspects of the study relevant to your topic being reviewed for example, in a study of heart disease, perhaps some of the main concepts are arthrosclerosis hypertension and obesity note these Concepts and then write a brief summary about how the article incorporates them.

This means that sometimes a scientific literature review can be highly theoretical in addition. It focuses on the results and methods of previous studies. It often has a more extended analysis and goes into greater detail all of the sections of this kind of review refer to the literature rather than detailing a specific current study in this example of a literature review in the journal. There are two features that distinguish it first the words literature review are contained in the title. Well, it is not necessary to include this exact term many literature reviews do indicate the type of article in their title. The second feature one notices is the length of the text. It is much longer than the literature review that introduces the study the headings indicate, what kind of literature is being discussed and how it contributes to the topic at the end of the review is a conclusion that once again explicitly ties all of these words together to show how this analysis is itself a contribution to the literature.

But if you the first 200 students to use my very exclusive link below in description here again to then you get the first two months free. Alright, so let's get started everyone Kerry Simon, of course a churro So today, we're going to take a look at what our Design Systems if you if you look at the internet and definitions of Design Systems, they seem to vary and there's a lot of vague Concepts the floating round and definitions. So I'm going to help break that all down or going to take a look at a few definitions and they're going to look at several examples in at the end. You're going to see I'm pretty confident you're going to have solid idea and so understanding of what actually a design system is. Coming up in the video a few days next week. I'm going to show you also how to build anything and create and design system from scratch first. It's important for you to understand what it is to make sure you watch this first. Alright. So for today's question did I do a good job explaining Design Systems. So usually these questions kind of don't have much relevance to the actual topic. But today I guess I'm going to do a little bit of user feedback. So please only answer this question after you after you watch the video and then let me know if you thought I did a good job or if I could have improved elsewhere. All right, so let's get started. Alright, so first what is a design system, so instead of giving you my own interpretation of what I think of design system is I thought it would be a little bit better to give you four examples from around the internet of what others need to be redesigned system.

Was on one side and functions of the other side they are decoupled. Now, let's take a look at the object into way to solve this problem. We can have an employee object properties a salary over time than rate and a method called get wait. The lace is better. Well, first of all, look at the gift wage function this function has no parameters in contrast the procedural example Market wage function has three parameters.

So first up here is Google's material design material diode. Is it this as wealth one now, if you look up here material is a design system, they self-identify as a design system. This is a design system. All right, so let's check it out here just a bit just so we can see how they approach and what makes up their particular design system. Alright, so first we'll just shake a look at design because see we have they have to split up into three different sections design development tools now over here. We have a sidebar navigation. So the. System to provide you with an introduction in the material studies page, which I never even check that out. I'll be honest with you but we have over here some more elements that you would probably be more familiar with if you're used to this sort of thing. For instance. They have a layout section where they have responsive layout grid spacing spacings always commenting these things navigation color. Of course topography. I've covered all this stuff in my visual Identity Design course, but you can see the design system is more than just that.  obviously also see we have guidelines documentation for emotion and The Innovation maybe boil down the speed. And communication we can also check out develop to see what they have here. They split this up in four different.

There was a now-famous conference that was jointly organized between IBM research and MIT at Endicott house where this topic was exploring more detailed and the plenary speaker was none other than Richard Fineman.Fineman proposed in that conference that if you wanted to simulate nature, we should build a quantum computer and I'm going to explain you what that means and how its created at the problems that it will solve but first I got to tell you what is the fundamental idea the fundamental idea just like we have bits in The Classical world that can be 0 or a 1 in a quantum computer.

Just also the which what this book is all about about the second phase in the first place. Basically, you have conferences YouTube movies. I don't know books and stuff like that. So you don't know don't need me to tell you how to do these things probably also like to work with data from so you can figure this thing out yourself. So what's the next phase basically the first. Stage in this phase also the fourth stage. Basically if you follow this diagram is basically the themes so let's make an example then. Let's assume I am in a modern environment and I have three teams which to devops. And in this case. I visualize it by having a deaf and Ops. No, I'm not saying those should be different. Also. I'm just visualizing here. So it's much easier to talk about it. But what about them? But how do you what's wrong with having these themes and having infrastructure as code deter from it's basically that you need to decide how can you separate these themes with each with each other in an infrastructure level so you can think of about saying, okay. I'll just create one AWS account and I'll put all the teams in there and I'll have acceptance and production together. But in my opinion is much better to maybe think about saying okay. I will have an account for acceptance and production or even better what I.

This stack Quest assumes you already understand the basics of least squares and linear regression. So if you're not already down with that check out the quest.  In statistics machine learning and other data science fields. We optimize a lot of stuff when we fit a line with linear regression. We optimized the intercept and the slope. When we use logistic regression, we optimize the squiggle. And when we use teeth knee we optimize clusters. These are just a few examples of the stuff. We optimize there are tons more the cool thing is that gradient descent can optimize all these things and much more. So if we learn how to optimize this line using gradient descent, then we'll have learned the strategy that optimizes this squiggle and these clusters and many more of the optimization problems. We have in statistics machine learning and data science. So let's start with a simple data set. On the x-axis we have weight on the y-axis. We have height if we fit a line to the data and someone tells us that they wave 1.5 we can use the line to predict that they will be 1 Point 9 tall. So let's learn how gradient descent can fit a line to data by finding the optimal values for the intercept and the slope actually will start by using gradient descent to find the y-intercept then once we understand how gradient descent Works will use it to solve for the intercept and the slope. So for now, let's just. "", ""transcriptId"": ""61db8c39-3620-489a-9d69-d781aedf46a0""}",2019-08-07 13:05:50,2019-08-07 13:05:50,,false,"61db8c39-3620-489a-9d69-d781aedf46a0"

So even if the step size is large if there have been more than the maximum number of steps gradient descent will stop. Okay, let's review what we've learned so far. The first thing we did IS decide to use the sum of the squared residuals as the loss function to evaluate how well a line fits the data then we took the derivative of the sum of the squared residuals. In other words. We took the derivative of the loss function. Then we picked a random value for the intercept this case. We set the intercept to be equal to zero. Then we calculated the derivative when The Intercept equals 0 plug that slope into the step size calculation and then calculated the new intercept the difference between the old intercept and the step."", ""transcriptId"": ""61db8c39-3620-489a-9d69-d781aedf46a0""}",2019-08-07 13:05:34,2019-08-07 13:05:34,,false,"61db8c39-3620-489a-9d69-d781aedf46a0"

So if you're not already down with that check out the quest and statistics machine learning and other data science fields. We optimized a lot of stuff when we fit aligned with linear. We optimize the intercepted in the when we use logistics compression. We optimize quick and let me use we optimized Clusters. These are just a few examples of the stuff we there are tons more the cool thing is a great to consent can optimizing all these things and much more. So if we learned how to optimize this line using gradient a*sent and will have learned the strategy that not and these clusters and many more of the optimization problems. We have in statistics machine learning data science. So let's start with a simple data set on the x access we have weight on the Y access we have height if we fit line to the data if someone tells us that they weigh one point five we can use the line to predict that they will be one point tall. So let's learn how radiant descent can fit a line to data by finding the optimal value for the set and the actually we'll start by using to find understand then once we understand how gradient works.

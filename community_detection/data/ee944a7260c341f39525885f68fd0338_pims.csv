What books are nothing more than HTTP messages that are sent usually responds to some event from a third party service that you're using. They're also sometimes used to describe pre-built API endpoints you can use to send down to web Hooks and apis are so closely related that sometimes what books are called reverse apis because they saw a very important problem with apis for apis the user like you and I will request data from an API and the API will give a response a common use case for web hooks that when you're interested in data changes. So imagine you're running an application that uses the GitHub API and you're requesting information about the commits for a given project program location is you want to perform some action. Once there's a new commit on that project getting that data from getting that's not very hard to Simply use their API and then you get a list of all the commits for a given project. So in this case, you could record the hash of the last commit and then just run it over and over and over and over again and just keep checking to see if that has changes if it does change then, you know, there's a new commit and then your application.Fond as it should there's a couple problems doing it this way. Number one is complete waste of bandwidth and server resources and but number two and this is more important is that GitHub has a cap on the number of API requests you can do. So now enter the world of web hooks where you can just tell git Hub when there's a new commit send a message in this way is no extra bandwidth moisture API calls and there's no limits are going to hit. So I'm using this web of tests or service which gives me a URL to send my response to one thing you do need is a place to send the web to so in my case is just the tester so I can simply go to settings for my repo go to web hooks. I can add a new web hook. You can paste that with book test URL I can say give it to me in Json navel is sell send me the whole push event at a web hook and we're done so you can set the hook is created. We sent a pink payload. So come on over to our tester. We see that we did get one post request from GitHub with a little phrase here in the Bookshop.

And what it means is that in a pot. I can have running containers and you can have one or more. So in order to run that pot I need to specify some sort of container image. Maybe I would have to container images and further down the line. There's other things like what TCP port and we're Services running or what not.

Maybe they would send you a web hook for a new charge which contain you know, how much the charge was who made the charge and so on remember I said, there's a second type of web hook where it's a prebuilt kind of pre-built API endpoint and you can use that to send data to own example, that is Discord with hooks. Usually when Services play nice with one another you're able to send web hosting one service to another to attain some new functionality on the other service. So imagine I wanted to post in my Discord server every time there was a commitment to a project on get home. This would be really easy to do when you're going to Discord under the Web book section and create a web hook I can say where I want to post it and then I can take this URL for the web code and I can. I would then take that URL and I would put it to get out so I can add a new web hook I can use my Discord URL Discord wants you to put GitHub at the end that way they know it's from GitHub and they can do something Fancy with it set up creation.

You can see if I'm over here get home at one new commit really hope this makes into this court. Keep in mind. It's not always this easy to integrate to Services together. The reason this works is because this court has already looked at GitHub webhook format and said if you put slash GitHub at the end of the whip hook link to sort will be able to parse that message and it makes something nice on your server any service that you use that has an API is most likely going to implement at least some web Hooks and that's because there's always going to be data that they using these subscribe to oftentimes the data you get from a web Hook is the.

Then you just component from the docker hub using Docker Pope and the image name. You may also include a tag if one is available which may specify a version or variants of the software. If you don't specify a tag the latest version will be what's attached to run a container pulled down from the docker Hub or build the image and then enter Docker run followed by the image name. There are of course many options available when running your container such as running it in detached mode with tech D or assigning ports for web services. You can view your running containers with Docker container LS and as you add more they'll appear here.Bring a single container is fun. But it's annoying to enter all of these commands to get a container running and we may want to control several containers as part of a single application such as running an app and a database together something you might want to do to run WordPress, for example, and we're going to be accomplishing that with Docker compose in our next video where we build a 23 terabyte Home Server.

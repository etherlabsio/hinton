They're there to make sure that it stays on track depending on what type of roads are driving up ultimately the goal is to connect the business's needs to the users needs. If the users needs are to take in content to purchase some sneakers to book a reservation the user experience designers making the tickets that they sell or the shoes that they're promoting or easily accessible in the experience of purchasing. It is a delightful one. It's complicated role. I mean, it's part designer. It's part strategist. It's part marketer its part like analytical kind of like tester. It's a really really. Interesting role to play and it's not just Visual Basic. It's much more analytical puzzly kind of like I want to see how this makes people feel and come up with some good Solutions. All design is coming up with solutions to problems. This is just a different facet of that discipline. How do you know that you're a good fit to do user experiences? I've had you know that this is something that would interest you and you should pursue. Well number one. If you're a problem solver. I think user experience design could be for you. If you're a little bit more cognitive. I think user experience can be for you. If you're more analytical you're interested in what people are thinking and feeling while they're doing something almost psychological in nature then maybe it's a little bit more for you. If you're more inclined to make something look interesting and look enticing versus be usable and feel good and maybe you I would be more for you which read talk about momentarily last few things on user experience design.

They're both designed disciplines and they are related to one another although they are very very different in their nature. Ux design is a little bit more analytical and UI design as a little bit more Visual and more closely related to something like graphic design though, the two are similar in some ways.

We're back to the non server list part. So to ecq basically elastic load balancing allows you to basically distribute incoming requests across multiple ec2 instances, you might have because often for bigger applications. You don't just have one server you have multiple servers multiple ec2 instances, maybe also spun out while Auto scaling and elastic load balancing then is a way of you automatically routing incoming requests you two different instances so that you don't have nine instances where one takes all the work and eight are eiling but where you instead distribute requests across all nine instances. So let's see compute section is about running your code storage as the name suggests is about storing your data. You could say most importantly we get the Amazon simple storage service or AWS S3, which is the. All the service the service with which AWS originally launched S3 is a service which is an object storage, which allows you to upload anything words documents text documents images videos HTML files. Whatever it is, you can put it into S3, you could use it as your private cloud storage, but you can also use for many other things. Of course, you can access it from an ec2 instance for example, so that you could basically create a web server where people can upload images and you would store these images not on ec2 which would be a bad idea because if you ever terminate that instance the images would be gone because they're just on the virtual server instead you would reach out to as free for example and store the images there. That's one possible use case. There are thousands of use cases you can all do use as free as a static web host which means you can run static websites so websites, which me.

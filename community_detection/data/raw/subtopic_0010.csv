Let me just get experience Docker as well using containers for popular apps like Plex Media Server next cloud and many other open-source apps and tools many of which we will be installing in upcoming videos Docker is a form of virtualization but unlike virtually the resources are shared directly with the host. This allows you to run many Docker containers where you may only be able to run a few virtual machines. You see a virtual machine has to quarantine office set amount of resources.

I thought makes a lot of trivial things really easy, but it's simple yet powerful syntax. Here are a few of the reasons why python is so popular. It's a high-level language. So you don't have to worry about complex tasks such as memory management like you do in C++. It's cross platform, which means we can build and run python applications on Windows Mac and Linux. It has a huge community. So whenever you get stuck, there's someone out there.It has a large ecosystem of libraries and Frameworks and tools which means whatever you want to do. It is likely that someone else has done it before because python has been around for over 20 years. So in a nutshell python is a multi-purpose language with a simple clean and beginner-friendly seen taxed all of that means python is awesome. Technically everything you do with python and do with other programming languages, but python Simplicity and elegance has made it growth play more than other programming languages. That's why it is the number one language employers are looking for. So whether you are a programmer or an absolute beginner learning python opens up lots of job opportunities to you.

We already know what data is but this data could be random a database is the systematic collection of data since the data in a database is organized. It makes data management easy. What is a database management system dbms database management system or dbms is a collection of programs which enables its users to access.The database manipulate data and help in the representation of data. It also helps control access to the database by various users. Let's discuss a few examples and online telephone directory would definitely use database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details.

I've had some the middleman on Linux machines and even Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 and above this means you can run any version of Linux in a container and it will run natively. Not only that Docker uses less disk space to as it is able to reuse files efficiently by using a layered file system. If you have multiple Docker images using the same base image for instance copper will only keep a single copy of the files needed and share them with each container. All right. So, how do we use Docker install Docker on your machine and will provide the links in the description begin with a Docker file, which can be built into a Docker image which can be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The dockerfile is a surprisingly Simple Text document that instructs how the docker image will be built like a blueprint you first select a base image to start with using the from keyword which you can find a container to use from the docker Hub. Like we mentioned before a bun to an Alpine Linux are popular choices from there. You can run commands such as downloading installing and running your software of course will link the docks below. What's the docker file is complete we can build it using Docker build followed by the T Flags. Neymar image and pass our commands the location of the dockerfile once complete you can verify your images existence with Docker images. Now, you're built image can run a container of that image or you can push it to the cloud of to share with others speaking of sharing with others. If you don't create your own Docker image and you just want to use a premade one component from the docker hub using Docker bolt and the image name, you may also include a tag if one is available which may specify a version or variant of the software. If you don't specify a tag the latest version will be what stached to run a container pull it down from the docker Hub rebuild the image and then answer Docker run followed by the image name. There are of course many options available when running your container such as running it detached mode with tact D or assigning ports for web services. You can view your running containers. with as you add more they'll.  running a single container is fun, but it's annoying to enter all of these commands to get a container running."", ""transcriptId"": ""315c7caa-5397-42f9-9bed-3114c8366878""}",2019-07-04T10:22:55.834Z,2019-07-04T10:22:55.834Z,,false,315c7caa-5397-42f9-9bed-3114c8366878

My students ask me about python. What is python what he can do with it? And why is it so popular in other words? What does it do than other programming languages don't python is the world's fastest growing and most popular programming language not just amongst software Engineers, but also marks mathematicians data analysts scientists accountants Network engineers and even kids because it's a very big in our friendly programming language. So people from different disciplines just python for a variety of different tasks such as data analysis and visualization artificial intelligence and machine learning Automation. In fact, this is one of the big users of python amongst people who are not software developers. If you constantly have to do boring repetitive tasks such as copying files and folders around renaming them uploading them to a server can easily write a pie.Script to automate all that and save your time and that's just one example, if you continuously have to work with Excel spreadsheets PDFs CSV files download websites and parse them you can automate all that stuff in Python. So you don't have to be a software developer to use Python. You could be an accountant and mathematician or a scientist and use Python to make your life easier. You can also use Python to build web mobile and desktop applications as well as software testing or even hacking so python is a multi-purpose language if you have some programming experience, you may say but most other programming languages. So what's the big deal about python here are a few reasons with python. You can solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of code. Here's an example. Let's say we want to extract the first three letters of the text. Hello world. This is the code we have to write in C sharp. This is how we do it in JavaScript.

So you have to be stuck with twelve Python which was an count us and or a*signed and just python on the domain live easier. It can also just five to build web as for a software testing or happening. So five is language. I have some do I say my with other priority.

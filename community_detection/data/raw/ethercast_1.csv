The compilation time doesn't generally exceed Beyond 5 seconds for us is never and we've seen enough case studies and experience reports by different companies around their experience with writing large managing large pieces of code in go and how compilation has been blazing fast for them. So for us comparison is never been a concern but definitely some things that will come into problem RCI steps, right? How do you test everything?. To make a comment to change or if you factor something that gets you know that have like repercussions occurs different queries support based now, that's something we need to continue to work on but even then one other thing is in our build systems based on the deployments that we have. So we deploy the API or the slack connector or we deploy a web socket Gateway or the Lambda functions whenever you we configure the builds up in such a way when you trigger a push to one of those code bases it basically runs simple compiled from the main main file for that specific code base and tries to see if it compiles or not at least that right now seems to be working but definitely and because a lot of the code.

So in general in Microsoft's oriented approach people tend to treat each new entity has its own service just because they think that's the way it should be but doesn't have to do right. So you need to figure out how different parts system can work independently from each other and what system parts need to talk to other parts of system, right?

Create its own create a separate system with its own pain and constant and have interactions between these things. So to give an example in a monolith you like at least in Ruby on Rails. You would have a folder called models, right and you put the minting entity would put the transcription entity.

So you have meeting domain package you have transcriptions are like that. So that sort of isolates are I/O from the core important parts of your system, right? So that's also some important thing from domain and it's also good practice, especially you will see this in functional programming languages where you try to separate I/O from just errorless systems system that don't generate errors because of network or any kind of other kind of the room. So they just operate on the input and give a competition give you a result and you choose should cooperate decide what to do based on the result that you get and even though they can be moved down to the legs. So that's also part of the domain driven design.Now definitely one of the problems are I wouldn't call it wrong. But one of the challenges with building something like a mono repo or the system that we've built right now is transactions extremely hard distribution transactions pretty hard in a Ruby on Rails. You can just apply it and endured a acquire a database lock or a transaction log with an isolation level. You can just do a complete roll back if you want to do which given the nature of the system that we're building a it's it's doesn't require that amount of consistency just lucky just we were lucky in that manner but in some places we might so we end up having to create another layer of abstractions or things you stagger patterns and things like that where you want to have a system like an orchestrated a choreographer, whichever you might use and different responsibilities, but they operate on the events the. I'm generates try to tie different pieces of services together and tries to hold information and generate new events or other service to interact on and try to form that kind of seemed so they try to hold.

So using conferences force. The clarify using composition over intelligence is very useful and the way goal does to is pretty nice that is very interesting the old font the language and doesn't have more than keywords. So this is very small language at its score. So there's useful and they also goes on explicit code right? So there weren't things like lot of use of reflection at least every everywhere like would use an base programming like one would add in Java like frame. Basically next spring or where you use the like you use dependency injection to solve the dependency version and most of it was this random time dependency and spring is basically branded independently injection framework.

So when they write their own Define types to everything so getting a compilation errors is not a easy.

It's not easy right in the sense that you don't have a simple curl replacement protocol buffers. I can just not give them like a maybe Swagger may be they may open API. They might be supporting it now, but we can't spawn can just simply give you like a request to just test it out and play around with it.

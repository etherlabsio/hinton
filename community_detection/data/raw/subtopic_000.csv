No problem. If you want to build python applications run build C++ applications, they can do all those things not just C sharp dotnet into Azure. Okay. So get started reset your account up and once you do you just something like this only you'll not have any projects open yet. Now on this account, I have two projects myself and we'll get into the lifecycle project. We use to kind of demonstrate all the things you can do in bsts or inventory manager devops.But if you're going to start out upper right hand corner, it says create project and here you get a project name was being this name regularly lifecycle project and they give a description which is what shows up right here. The project name and description can be changed later. If you want to now in my settings, I have turned them off the ability to have a public repository or public be espera devops platform. Now, you can change that if you want in an organizational policies either turn on or turn them off. So if my by default is turned off so that I don't accidentally create a public project. But if you want to be able to project that's great also notice that as your devops does allow for public bodies just like GitHub does and if you do create an open source project that would be a lot more benefits as far as how many different price we can pilot the same time and how including have the project and things like that. So there's a lot of benefits may be doing open source project, but I find typically products are closed source.It's something you can you privately or want to actually sell those options are all you need to get started. However, the advanced options do allow for two more weeks in the first one. I would recommend you not change unless you really want to.

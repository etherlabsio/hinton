So those concerns definitely come up with the transportation layer. We need to worry about. What protocol you want to use the time to talk to between service or the wire? What is the seasonal ization you want format you want to do is protocol buffers. Jason is the one used our PC or casein over HTTP whatever it is. So you move those concerns up to a layer above and you have interfaces around the right. So one should be easily be able to swap out an HTTP RPC implementation with a G RPC implementation without having to change the systems the service layer the repository layer which are talk about this after this the caching systems are any business logic layer? So you want to when you make the change your goal should be to not permeate your changes down to every part of the system, right? If you're touching a layer the changes that you implement should only touch that layer so that you don't have to test every other part of system. Thereby making your code more.Sorry robust, right? So that's the concern of the transportation layer. So how you deal with those pieces of stuff now having now when you were in the service layer or the controller layer you do do some IO related work. You do talk to other services you talk to the databases you talk to caching systems."", ""score"": 1.56169245195699, ""offset"": -1, ""source"": ""channel_mind"", ""status"": ""completed"", ""userId"": ""62b6ae1d7f834b0bb2055f7c72bc3368"", ""deleted"": false, ""createdAt"": ""2019-07-24T17:09:40.253455454Z"", ""deletedAt"": null, ""segmentId"": ""1f37d9f2cf7444a2b73e2608b04f3527"", ""sentiment"": {}, ""updatedAt"": ""2019-07-24T17:10:55.623842271Z"", ""wordcount"": 310, ""recordingId"": ""49305fbfc4d140ab8ddf42e0a433022f"", ""transcriptId"": """"}",2019-07-24T17:09:40.253Z,2019-07-24T17:10:55.623Z,,false,68278dc5-403e-4500-9305-70b78a73faed,completed

So right now it's pretty fast at least on the front end point. It's not a concern go. Now. This is where a partly for the platform. This has been a pretty good thing with the one of the good actions go it going with the language here was go because go irrespective of the size of the code base. The compilation time doesn't generally exceed Beyond 5 seconds for us is never and we've seen enough case studies and experience reports by different companies around their experience with writing large managing large pieces of code in go and how compilation has been blazing fast for them. So for us comparison is never been a concern but definitely some things that will come into problem RCI steps, right? How do you test everything?. To make a comment to change or if you factor something that gets you know that have like repercussions occurs different queries support based now, that's something we need to continue to work on but even then one other thing is in our build systems based on the deployments that we have. So we deploy the API or the slack connector or we deploy a web socket Gateway or the Lambda functions whenever you we configure the builds up in such a way when you trigger a push to one of those code bases it basically runs simple compiled from the main main file for that specific code base and tries to see if it compiles or not at least that right now seems to be working but definitely and because a lot of the code.

The other concern the other thing was definitely go routines was a really big bone of the concurrency is how concurrency is managed in go is very nice. It's based on aah horse paper on concurrence communicating sequential processes, which is its own thesis Etc. But essentially the way you reason about how system should interact between how different parts is system should interact not by sharing memory by through communicating is was a big car with a very interesting and a good concept similarly similar to Elixir. It's essentially but a different Implement different thought processes using threats not using processes and Community was growing I could sense.

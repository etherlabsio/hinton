But if your website isn't showing up towards the top three results or so or if it isn't even on the first page, it's almost like your website doesn't exists. No one can even find it now in our example we search for California sandals and we got back about twenty two million website results. It's not exactly a small number. Have you ever wondered why some websites show up on this first page and others are stuck way down at the bottom of the pile. Well a sites position in search results is determined by what's referred to as page rank. Every website has a ranking for particular Search terms or keywords in the beginning the first search engines work by. All the words on web pages. So if you search for California sandals, you get back a list of websites containing those two keywords and the web sites that had those words most often. We're ranked higher and they showed up for the top five results Pages. Well in 1996 to Stanford PhD students notice while they were researching academic papers that sources that contain a lot of keywords didn't necessarily mean they were more relevant what matter a lot more was whether those papers were cited Often by other papers. So they applied this citation concept to web search they suggested websites that were backlink a lot that is this a we referred to Often by other websites or more likely to be relevant. That's how Google was born. Search engines today all follow this model. They still look at your websites keywords, but they then rank your site's relevance on the number and quality of backlinks to it from other websites. So think of it like this keyword."", ""transcriptId"": ""e5d99e59-c595-4730-84c1-2239078a7eff""}",2019-08-07 20:51:20,2019-08-07 20:51:20,,false,e5d99e59-c595-4730-84c1-2239078a7eff

It doesn't exist. You have documentation, right? There's there's Swagger and we'll talk about that later. But you have you have talking to you go to a website and says this is how the rest API works and these are the parameters that you can expect. But if you want to point a machine at a rest API and say like can you tell me the property is about this endpoint and what parameters it accepts and what types it accepts you don't have that and so that means that when you want to write client libraries, you have to get humans to do it and and humans are expensive and they don't like writing client libraries streaming is difficult and rest apis you very rarely see streaming in rest apis because most libraries there are a lot of libraries and languages that it's not a good fit for that don't support it. Well, and if you want to do something like bi-directional streaming you just can't so that's difficult. They're. So tons of like I can't tell you the number of conversations. I've sat in when designing an API or someone's like oh man. Well this operation restarts the machine like well, what do we do? Do we post to the restart and point? That doesn't make any sense? How do we fit this into the restful Paradigm? Because there are plenty of things that don't fit well into the restful paradigm. It's inefficient, right? It's all text-based which is great for introspection. But when you actually like want to do things really quickly and you want to use as little of the network is possible.

Maybe you ask for dinner support in addition to filtering out bills that you aren't necessarily going to use graphql allows for really excellent relational queries, and I'll show you what I mean here in a real environment in a second that allows you to well save trips. For instance the YouTube API. Keep going back to this one with the YouTube API you hit it and you get a list of videos which is essentially the video IDs, but if you want all of the information. You know about that particular video you have to then go back to the API and you have to say oh, yeah, so okay. I got this ID, but now that I have this ID.

Then you ask for what you want right? So this is the actual queries so instead of hitting an API just accepting data you say hey give me the project was the name of and return it that add okay and then the results come back with exactly what you asked for which is a object with project and rather than just a whole bunch of stuff maybe you ask work didn't have to no decision to build three that you are going to use you allows for really excellent relational queries and I'll show you what I mean here in a real environment in a second that allows you to well safe trips for instance, the YouTube API I keep going this one with the YouTube apI you hit it and you get a list of videos which is essentially the video I IDS but if you want all of the information about that particular video you have to then go back to the API and you have to oh yeah so okay I got this. Now that I have this idea pay you YouTube once more to tell me all of the information about this video when great you can do this an extremely relational queries that only make it. So you have to do one trip one trip for the API data comes back. Okay so is a query language is a way to get data from an API into your application. So to well, well, two actually a specification and the fact that graph was created by Facebook is one of those things I can worry people they can say well I don't I don't want to use some Facebook technology because of maybe Facebook reputation.

So you're not stuck using Facebook projects and there's for a lot of interesting ideas not only that but you can use graph to well on any sort of platform. So if we went to the code part of this site you can see that of two parts right. There's the server component and there's the client component. Now if an a P i has a graph to server that already exist. You can just use that with only right? Well you need to learn the server side stuff but if you're building a full stack app such as level of tutorials you need a server library as well. So the call part l is that there's just all this choice. So you can see that we go to server libraries and there's categories where you can find to implementation and all of these different languages. And if I were to select Javascript. You can see that well we have some options too well that crack too. Well we have a follow server which is what I'm using and all of these are great because again we i gives us options to use something let me explain a little bit while with the server actually the server essentially takes in your API you write your API as a series of type definitions. So you're defining the shape of your data and which is stuff like a query right? I think you the that's going to be in the results and then the server sort of takes all of that stuff in and exposes."", ""transcriptId"": ""e5d99e59-c595-4730-84c1-2239078a7eff""}",2019-08-07 21:18:59,2019-08-07 21:18:59,,false,e5d99e59-c595-4730-84c1-2239078a7eff

Json and rest are great. They have I mean there's a reason that all of the web service API is built in practically the last 10 years have been HTTP and rest designs and just like the very most basic reasons why I like we don't have to go over these things. Like we all know this but like they're easy to understand right? Like there there a text-based protocol. You can look it up like we have so many great tools right that have all been built around this ecosystem. Even before right the fact that this is already how the web works is via HTTP and content negotiation. Like the fact that we could build apis using those tools using the way that the web already worked was just it was great. Right and it had lots of other great things going for it. Like the fact that there were really great implementations because of the fact that that's how the web works, but I have to tell you something if I never write another rest client library in my life. I will die a happy man.I hate writing Rest client libraries and yet when you're building lots of web apis lots of web services. You create an API and you're like yeah, I made a web API and someone's like hey man, did you write like I don't want to work with an HTTP clients you write a library in c-sharp like oh man. Oh, I forgot see Sharon right one and C sharp. I got okay. Well, I don't really want to use your your library. And this is a problem for businesses right who like expose these apis to their customers, but it's also a problem internally when you're building applications, they build an application you and you say to another team. Hey, will you integrate with my service and like, you know you can you can you build me a library for that you like? No, I don't want to build you a library for that. Anyways until how much I hate writing client libraries, but there are lots of reasons that that rest is not as good as it could be and so like I was saying.

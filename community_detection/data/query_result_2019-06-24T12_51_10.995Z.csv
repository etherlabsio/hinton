The second one and I think ontology but is on hold ich schenke is looking was looking into it. Maybe he can talk about that and the other one mainly restoring the key phrases 244 both chapters and Kim's I'm working on that. So I'm just a half very rough approach. I just need to test it and see how it works on the on the current chapter key phrases and The Pimps. Maybe I'll have to create a comparison approach wherein we can see the existing chapter key phrases and then the rank ones and then I will work on it and the possibly by maybe Thursday I should have this one.

So you should be okay the second thing you say we need to think about this conference initiation unlike others. You don't get to create a room separately. The first person to join ends up creating the room right now. So and it is doing it through also D, which is like an xmpp client on Gypsy. So one thing we can try is take the same domain names and join as a user to accept a PICC lines on the back end if you want to initialize a conference.Right so that we can spend one and I can say hey this is the last nominee nominee is a number of last in chance really to create because it is you're allocating a room in Trinity. We do bridge so you have to specify the last 10 globally for that meetings. You can do all of that stuff that suit the way I was smoking Wars. That when you which let's take this flow, right the background you have to submit configure your type / eat the booth. Recording client gets initiated recording giant joins and it sets the last time. Yeah. So the question is the problem that is if the last and same I think anyone can join in other words Ron's first and can can end up creating that thing. The recording climb not doesn't necessarily join the call immediately before the others, right? Because if you click on the link that is shown you just click on both your fingers a window where someone else can join before because I drink line is nobody in that case if you click on it is we're okay because we will be doing the only cases is someone who's completely unknown exact science project. So that what we should do is return the connectors, you can get a cheap product package of the service all it does is it creates the basic information?.

He is trying to play around with the legitimate code base to figure out okay, what are the events being emitted? This is basically for Equity recording planned implementation for The Big C. So the problem is that for recording clients. We need the media stream and we have to manipulate the rendering of the Dom element of the most recent speaker on to that is terrific. So that's all the stuff that is required. I will also have to do the same process of mixing the different tracks into one audio track and sending it like a created and extreme and sending it to the speech capture of instance to perform this one.Also task was what I'm trying to do this within according to implementation. There are some issues were sometimes it works but there are a lot of events that we need to subscribe and we update the main video frame with active to show that this is the most cases because it for example, look at the person certainly mutes himself. We need to go get the last active speaker before that and then go render that person speed and reopen it with same thing and the lot of people we need to capture Source not able to understand what it will consistently produce the same track and bring sometimes sometimes in Nepal joints. I just see a blank void things. So it's just that I'm going what I'm doing is I'm going to see meat for see where our water although even today use handling to re-render the video large video frame and trying to reproduce himself, but some of them are real.

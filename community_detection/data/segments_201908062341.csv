I find that this is a great summary. So you were talking about services that you would use for hosting your own web page. For example, because your own webpage made up of PHP code node code HTML code.Things like Dad. This is all code that needs to be executed. The HTML code actually just needs to get served to the client to be executed there. But if you're generating it on the server, let's say with a framework like Claire. Well, then you need to run code in order to generate that HTML. So things like that can be done with services in the compute section Amazon ec2 is one of the most prominent services offered by AWS and it essentially allows you to spin up your own server or to be precise your own virtual instance of a computer. So your spin up a future in the cloud and you're not limited to hosting websites there. You can do anything on that run your personal strips. You don't even need to connect it to the internet.

If you're thinking about trading a gaming PC there that will be a bit tougher because obviously it's just a server to which you connect through the terminal you got no desktop no monitor connection, but in the end you can do whatever you want on that. So Amazon ec2 is a very important Service as it allows you to run your code in the cloud. Of course one prominent use case is to turn this into a web server open it up to the Internet install a server like Apache and nginx and run your PHP code or run your node code things like that. Now we got our services related to that easy to auto-scaling basically is about adding capabilities to spin up more or less easy to service. So virtual instances depending on the traffic that's coming in. So if you need more servers, then you can spin them up all the manically container service is all about Docker images and deploying and managing these in the cloud light sail is essentially a service which. I was to get started with ec2 with custom servers some easily. So it's like more customer friendly version where you have to do less configuration. You can just spin up a web server. It's based on ec2 in the end though. Elastic Beanstalk is an average service which uses ec2 behind the scenes. It actually all the uses our services behind the scenes so that you can focus on bringing your web application to live and it will spin up and appropriate server configure all the scaling and load balancing. So that incoming requests are divided up equally on all instances. You've got spin up a database that is then all done for you. So lastic Beanstalk is like a meta service allowing you to manage our services behind the scenes so that you don't have to do everything on your own now Lambda is another important service your from the compute area. And this is now a different thing here. You don't spin up a custom server and it.

It works like this you simply take your code can be note python. Java asp.net c-sharp code you take that code put it into Lambda. So it gives you an interface where you can upload your code basically and then you can Define events that trigger that code that could be the upload of an image to a number 8 up US service that could be an incoming HTTP request qn API endpoint, which you can also Define with the number service all come back to you. So you get this event driven approach. You don't have a server that's running all the time instead your code only executes when that event happens and you only pay when that happens. So for easy to for our traditional server you pay all the time you pay for the app time, basically for Lambda you only pay for the execution and this of course is a very nice.It is actually a very trendy way of building applications where you have that event driven approach where you pay for what you use and where you only executes the code when you need to execute it. So where you don't have any idle time on a server behind the scenes? Of course, this still uses a server where it basically loads your code and runs it when required but you don't have to manage the server. You don't have to manage any capacities. You just put your coat there and it will execute when your event triggers if you want to learn more about them. I get ahold survivalist course where I dive into Lambda and connected Services, which allow you to spin up a bank and without you managing any servers. The last thing I want to cover in the compute section is elastic load balancing here. We're back to the non server last part. So too easy to basically elastic load balancing allows you to basically distribute incoming requests across multiple ec2 instances. You might have because.

You can just spin have a it's based on QA yet built the last being stock of a number service which it you P the teams it actually all the uses of services behind this scenes so that you can focus as on bringing your web application to live and it will spin up an appropriate server and figure all scaling and load balancing. So that been having requests are equally on all instance, got spin update database all time for you so the took it's like a service allowing to manage services behind the scenes so they don't have to do everything money roll now land that it's in not really important in service zoom only area and then it's now a different thing here you don't spin custom them server and."", ""transcriptId"": ""bd984759-3179-4ca4-bfca-f995b442bcc4""}",2019-08-06 23:06:02,2019-08-06 23:06:02,,false,bd984759-3179-4ca4-bfca-f995b442bcc4

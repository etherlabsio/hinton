But what if you're not using the airlines website which has direct access to the information what if you are using an online Travel Service that Aggregates information from many different airlines the Travel Service interacts with the airline's API. The API is in a face that like your helpful where can be asked by that online Travel Service to get information from the airline system over the internet to book seats choose meal preferences for baggage options. It also then takes the airline's response to your request and delivers it right back to the online Travel Service, which then shows it to you.

They all have apis that allow computers to operate them.That's what ultimately creates connectivity.

Not only that Docker uses less disk space to as it is able to reuse files efficiently by using a layered file system. If you have multiple Docker images using the same base image for instance Docker only keep a single copy of the files needed and share them with each container. All right. So, how do we use Docker install Docker on your machine and will provide links in the description begin with a Docker file, which can be built into a Docker image which can be run as a Docker container. Okay, let's break that down. The dockerfile is a surprisingly Simple Text document that instructs how the docker image will be built like a blueprint you first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the docker Hub. Like we mentioned before a bun to an Alpine Linux are popular choices.From there, you can run commands such as downloading installing and running your software of course will link the docks below once our Docker file is complete. We can build it using Docker build followed by the T flag so we can name our image and pass our commands the location of the dockerfile once complete. You can verify your images existence with Docker images. Now, you're built image can run a container of that image or you can push it to the cloud to share with others speaking of sharing with others. If you don't create your own Docker image and you just want to use a premade one in Poland from the docker hub using Docker full and the image names, you may also include a tag if one is available which may specify a version or variant of the software. If you don't specify a tag the latest version will be what statute to run a container pulled down from the docker Hub or build the image and then enter Docker run followed by the image name. There are of course many options available when running your containers such as running it in detached mode, but XD or assigning ports for web services, you can view your running containers with Docker container LS. And as you add more Bill appear here running a single container is fun, but it's annoying to enter all of these.Commands to get a container running and we may want to control several containers as part of a single application such as running an app and a database together something you might want to.","startTime":"2019-06-12T17:44:09Z","endTime":"2019-06-12T17:46:09Z","duration":120,"speaker":"fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315","status":"completed","createdAt":"2019-06-12T17:56:31.332592198Z","updatedAt":"2019-06-12T17:57:33.233512282Z","deletedAt":null,"deleted":false},{"id":"dbd60e9618974324856d6d348b3cecf0","text":"See how the family evolved with time the following diagram shows the evolution of categories.","startTime":"2019-06-12T17:38:01Z","endTime":"2019-06-12T17:38:12Z","duration":11,"speaker":"fb52cb663aec4795aee38ccfd904d315","status":"completed","createdAt":"2019-06-12T17:38:12.712621326Z","updatedAt":"2019-06-12T17:38:14.683529344Z","deletedAt":null,"deleted":false},{"id":"70e249d0d847400dbb8cb7b91a2d7fdd","text":"Are four major types of let's look into that in detail hierarchical.

So your software stay is system agnostic making software simpler to use less work to develop and easier to maintain and deploy these containers running on your computer or server act like little micro heaters each with very specific jobs each with their own operating system their own isolated CPU processes memory and network resources and because of this they can be easily added removed stop and start it again without affecting each.Or the host portion containers usually run one specific tasks such as a mySQL database or a node.js application and then their Network together and potentially scale it developer will usually start by accessing the docker Hub and online Cloud repository of Docker containers and pulled one containing a pre-configured environment for their specific programming language such as Ruby or nodejs with all the files and Frameworks needed to get started home users can experience Docker as well using containers for popular apps like Plex Media Server next cloud and many other open-source apps and tools many of which we will be installing in upcoming videos Docker is a form of virtualization but unlike virtual machines. The resources are shared directly with the host. This allows you to run many Docker containers where you may only be able to run a few virtual machines.

Okay, let's break that down. The dockerfile is a surprisingly Simple Text document that instructs how the docker image will be built like a blueprint you first select a base image to start with using the from keyword, which you can find a container to use from the docker Hub. Like we mentioned before a bun to an Alpine Linux are popular choices.From there, you can run commands such as downloading installing and running your software of course will link the docks below once our Docker file is complete. We can build it using Docker build followed by the T flag so we can name our image and pass our commands the location of the dockerfile once complete.

There are of course many options available when running your containers such as running it in detached mode, but XD or assigning ports for web services, you can view your running containers with Docker container LS.

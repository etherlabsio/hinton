They start off with all kinds of hand-sketched Concepts and then they turn it into higher Fidelity wireframes and then they evolved the design into a working prototype.A working prototype is tested and measured and analyzed the whole bunch of users sounds pretty scientific. Right? Well from those tests both the user researcher in the interaction designer are able to figure out what should be in the app. And what shouldn't and they test and tweak the design many many times to get a just perfect. Now. We have a perfect solution for the problem weight is not over yet. Another crucial step in the overall process is making a solution. And in this case our texting app look beautiful like unicorns. This is the handiwork of a visual designer who creates the look and feel of the app a visual designer focuses on things like logo typeface and layout and color scheme. So now we not only have a solution but it is a beautiful solution.So far we talked about the design process of a nap. Let's briefly talk about what it takes to design the phone itself people who design Hardware products like your phone or your car or even your vacuum cleaner, they're called industrial designers these designers go through a similar creative process like the one we just talked about.

You can possibly think of from food to sports to entertainment to healthcare and each case. They're following a similar process of researching prototyping iterating and testing to create products that are useful usable and delightful. So you may ask why does user experience matter? Well, we're all users of products and services if these products and services weren't designed for us. We would use them right. Would you use a texting app that wouldn't let you text easily.Was annoying no, but if you do design for users and you do get it, right, this means you can create strong positive relationships between the companies that offer the product and the people who use it. So the next time you are at a restaurant or a theme park or even just texting a friend know that there was a whole team of creative people behind your experience making it easy and enjoyable as possible.

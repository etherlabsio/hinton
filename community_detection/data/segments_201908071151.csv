My name is Tim Cory and my goal is to teach developers how learn C sharp the easy way in this video. That means I will be skipping all the history of threading that may enter some people but it really isn't relevant to what you need to know today instead. What you need to know is how to use a sink and a weight in the real world to make your apps faster and more responsive.Now just be clear about we're talking about let's go overwhelming by synchronous versus asynchronous synchronous programming is work that gets done in sequence task egg is done then task B, then Tessie and finally task D. The problem is that no one else can do any work until task D gives complete asynchronous programming allows us to fix that problem. There are two big benefits your as see right away when you use it. The first big benefit is in your user interface if task B take a long time that will lock up your user interface by execute a task. Asynchronously while their way into complete control can be given back to the user interface. So it's still responsive.The second benefit comes into play especially when task C and D. Don't rely on test be in fact, maybe not has to pay each other May. They're all just things that need to be done. We don't need to get data back. In that case, we can't execute them in parallel. That means as long as your system has the resources it will try to do all four tasks at once. If each task took three seconds to.

I wind up puts on a basic code together the I need to run the demo, but that didn't really apply to what we're talking about. I'll give you a quick run-through before you start. So this is WPF application is how does one form here for the user interface? It has a couple of basic things on it's got two buttons and it's got this results pane down here you have you'll see results pane, but that's right here. It's called results window. So we're going to do is write execute a task the way they normally would using this button and see the results down here and we'll see the user interface locks up and takes a little while and it ways to display the information on the screen. And then we're going to do is where I use this button here the async execute to allow us to do the same task but asynchronously and we'll see how you can use the user interface still and how you can actually even see the answers come in one line at a time instead of all at once at the end. Like it doesn't normally execute and we'll see all that in a little bit. That's our basic demo user interface now just a quick disclaimer here. This is WPF app, and I'm not using mvvm. I usually use mvvm with any kind of real the PF application. But in this case, it's just a demo.

I have to button click events the execute sync click, which that's this one right here. And then the execute a sink click which we this one right there. So the xqa sink is blank right now execute sink has some code in it and what this code does is as follows first, we've got the stopwatch start new and so I'm doing is I'm timing how long this takes so it do that is to start this stopwatch timer. Now, you don't want to use a daytime dot now and try and grab that because not quite as precise. This is much more precise where you start a stopwatch and at the very end, we stop it. And so everything in between gets timed. It will say okay. Here's the elapsed milliseconds between this line right here and this line right here.Which in theory will record how long this runs for?.  So there is an even more precise way of doing things that you really want to get down, you know deep into tracking your performance, but this is a really good performance counter for General stuff.

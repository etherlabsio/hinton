I'm not very big believer that people overthink this I think you can go anywhere with it. I think you're going to look at data and see what happens some people resonate on a personal level others. Don't again, I think this comes down to self-awareness.

The Windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes.Network dbms.  this type of dbms supports many to many relationships that's usually results in complex database structures RDM server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model relational dbms. This type of dbms defines database relationships in forms of tables also known as relations unlike the network dbms rdbms does not support many to many relationships relational dbms usually have predefined data types that they can support. This is the most popular dbms type in the market examples of relational database Management Systems include MySQL Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server object-oriented relational dbms this type support storage of new data types. The data to be stored is in the form of objects the objects to be stored in the database.

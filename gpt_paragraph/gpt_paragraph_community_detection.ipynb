    "This notebook applies paragraph embeddings from GPT (aggregated) and GPT+Bi-LSTM for community detection. It has been noted that GPT is capable of separating sub-topics into different communities at the paragraph level. Aggregated sentence features performs better with the pruning algorithm than the Bi-LSTM based features."

So people who do a additional just point for right of different tasks, which just need alysis and have our artificial intelligence task at when learning automation in fact, this is one of the big of Python amongst people are not suffer markers. If he some exploring or the time is copied five of folders around name of them not uploading them to the server.

So we can name our and pas our command the location of the file. Please you can verify your images existence with image neither build image can running a container on that image or even push to the cloud to share with others speaking of sharing with others if you do not agree on not room you just want to use screen made one component from the hub using and mega machine you may also include the tag if one is available which may specify a version server. If you do not specify tag, but version will be what is finished to running a container pull it down on knock hub or build the image and then run followed by the there are of course as many options available when running your container so I trying get mode the tap we are that towards for that services you can be running containers with container as you guys more built here here running a single container on, but it is annoying to all of these commands to get a container running.\n",

Now other available and make sure we get that off again and thanks for watching. Let know if you interested in your two would be those deeper the doctor or with over some six layers and so on and stick around coming up we are building a twenty three server using if you have any questions on channel going to that is a description.\n",

They could be facts related to any in consideration for example, your name type et cetera are some data related to you a picture image PDF et cetera and all be considered in data. Now what is the database we already know my data is, but this data that could be random a database it is a systemic collection data since the data in a database is it makes data management. What is a database management system database management system or is of programs, which enables its users to access the database seventeen data that help the representation of data and also house control access to the database by various users. Let is discuss a few examples an online telephone directory with used database management system to store data pertaining to people phone numbers and other contact details your electricity service provider is obviously using a to manage billing client related issues to handle data center. Let is consider the Facebook. It needs to store represent data related to members their friends member activities messages advertisnts and a lot more. We can provide how numbers of examples for usage of database management systems are not a new context. It is such a first implemented in the nineteen docments.\n",

      "2019-07-04 10:08:47   I am going to answer top free asking about Python. What is Python what it it and why it so popular in what does do that programming and language. I thought the fast growing and most popular language not just own offering to engineering, but all to have account that is engineer that kit because it is still same in a friendly pertinent language. So people who do a additional just point for right of different tasks, which just need alysis and have our artificial intelligence task at when learning automation in fact, this is one of the big of Python amongst people are not suffer markers. If he some exploring or the time is copied five of folders around name of them not uploading them to the server. It is easily write a license to automate all that time and that is just for to example, could have spreadsheet fifty down website to automate all the stuff python. So you have to be stuck with twelve Python which was an count us and or asigned and just python on the domain live easier. It can also just five to build web as for a software testing or happening. So five is language. I have some do I say my with other priority. So what is a big deal about Python here few reasons with Python accomplished products last time we you are example, let us we want to extract the first three letters of the text. The have to write this is how we do it in Javascript again, how we joining python. \n",

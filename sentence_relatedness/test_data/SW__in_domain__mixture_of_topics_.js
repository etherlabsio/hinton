"We have now created a simple network with Terraform on GCP. You can do a lot more with terraform such as setting up compute instances, firewall rules and much more. I thought this was necessary for the kinds of apps I was working on. And with that in mind, I tried many approaches and frameworks for implementing the same pattern: Single-page applications (SPA). The next thing we shall do is get the necessary credentials from GCP. Go to the GCP console menu and select APIs & Services then Credentials. Now click the Create Credentials button and choose Service Account Key. On the next screen choose Compute Engine default service account and JSON then click Create. This will download a json file to your computer, move this file to the folder where we shall write our terraform code. This file contains sensitive information so do not store it in a public repository or make it public."

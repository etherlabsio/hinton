      "most of you. How many of you actually used one? No, that's that's good. I gave this talk a similar talk. Clashing there was, too. So now we're up to about 10 or 15. How many of you actually put something into production with one? We're down about four. How many of you actually put it into production successfully? We're down to a couple. So that's sort of what the whole premise of this talk is to kind of walk through the process of what it actually takes to make a raft database implementation. Successful. Ah, so little bit about myself before we get started. So, uh, I've been doing this. I've been doing software development for about 20 years. Every time I say that, it starts to make me feel older and older a little more than 20 years now, But I don't want to admit how long. Ah, and I've done everything. I've been a little bit of everything. I started out. My actual first job was to build embedded, see programs on top of dos on. Other than that, everything they're through building out high through building out high performance websites. Most recently, I've been focused on big data problems specifically around building. Ah, high performance, low latent See data platforms. A lot of times, at least part of the Zeta platform has been leveraging crap leveraging a draft database. Currently, I am, ah, solutions, architect. Data s*x in the global graft practice. If you're not familiar with the data stacks is we are the Apache Ca*sandra people. Ah, we have our own distribution of Ca*sandra that integrates search a**lytics and then Graff on top of it, which is, uh, why I'm part of the global graph practice there. Most of the co author of an upcoming book by Manny called Graph Databases in Action On And if you are, if you want my that's my Twitter handle up in the corner. If you tweet out during this this presentation I have five free copies like I'll give away at the end. Doesn't have to be nice, but I would prefer it be nice. \n",

      "you talk about? Well, we're gonna talk. About what? Graft debate graph Databases are just so everybody has a little bit of a level set. Seems like most people who spit heard of them, which is great. And then why you should care about and why? Why? They're actually useful in some cases and not in others. Then when should use one? Because that's the biggest challenge I see when I work with people is they try to use a graft database for the wrong use case, and it just doesn't end up working. Then you can learn from my mistakes. As I said, I've been doing this. Probably. I've been working draft databases for about four or five years now. I've made a lot of the mistakes that you're gonna make when you start so learned from them. Try not to make. Let's not try not to repeat the same problems I did. And then last, we're gonna talk a little bit about how to make a successful project and and how to actually make that project you're working on successful or to know if it's not gonna be successful early, huh? So what's the gla*s database? Gra*s database the type of no sequel database that's built on top of graph theory. S O graph theory. If you've ever taken a discrete mathematics course, you've probably heard about the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem. Well, what that really comes down to is it comes down a graph theory. Basically, it gives a mathematical construct to how to describe ent*ties in the relationships between them ent*ties. They described it for Texas, which florals vergis ese Texas. It's actually who you ask, and they're represented most frequently by these circles. And edges represent the relationships between Vergis ease and they're represented by the lines. So you'll see that throughout this really what craft databases are all about. They're all they're all about handling highly connected data types. We'll talk about some examples here, coming up, but really they handle this highly connected data types in ways that allow you to get insights into what you're working into your data that you can't get using other technologies. So where do they fit? When I said I'd think about databases, I think about databases is kind of a spectrum of data complexity, irrespective of data complexity from very simple data to very complex data. And there's different databases and data stores out there that do work with each type. Very, very well, simplest. One key value store. We've all probably used a lot of time to use something like this for a cache in a key value store, really.\n",

      "well, that seems great. It's a pretty weak a*sociation because that relationship can't really add any value to that connection in and of itself. It's a pretty anemic thing because it's just a name you can't add any semantic value. That relationship can't have any connecting this to it, which is why you get down to those sorts of things. You end up with bridge tables in the link tables inside your relational database to really try and represent those sorts of those sorts of rich parts of a relationship that relational databases don't handle. That brings us to graft databases. Graft databases are all about handling the most complex, complex, interconnected data that is, that is, exists out in the thing. Why is that? Well, that's because gra*s are all built on relationships. The essence of a graph from both graph theory and in the graph database world is about relationships and the connectedness of your data. You'll hear me say this many times, but the one kind of major thing that graph database gives you are to know if you want to use a graft database is if if the connections between your data are as important or more important than the data itself. That's a really strong use case for a draft database. So what the graph databases look like? Well, when you start with them, they look like this. They look like any other conceptual data model. You go, Bill. This is actually a conceptual data model for Twitter. You know, you have a user at the center. That tweet has links to it. They have, you know, Hashtags are sources, there's media, and they're all interconnected with one another.\n",

      "zoologist type because the hype is strong with this one. You know, especially if you've been around and heard about graft databases the past few years, Graf databases are the perfect solution to every database problem out there. You should just use them for everything. No, I think we can all imagine. I'll can agree that there isn't one tool to solve every type of problem out there in the world. But that's kind of a graph. Databases have been portrayed as if you would do much research out there, what you'll come across that you'll come across this statement. Everything is a graph. Well, it's probably true. Everything in the world can probably be representative a graft, because everything is really about things and think in connections between things. But what really is missing from this statement when you start talking about it from a technical perspective, is just because it's a graph doesn't mean you should use a graft to solve it. You know, crafts are great for certain problems, and you can use them to solve most problems. But there are usually better technologies for a lot of rope. It's like I said, I work in graft consulting, and I probably most of the time, probably nine times out of 10. I worked with customers to tell them not to use a graft database to solve a problem. It was actually pretty rare. I was at the customer last week and I actually got to tell them to use a graft soldier problem. And it was, Ah, I was kind of a win.

Each one is atomic into itself onto itself. I should say, Get a little bit more. You wanna get a little bit more complex? Say you get wide columns, stores or column oriented databases. This is like Ca*sandra Google Big Table on Apache H Base. If you're familiar with those and these, basically, you really think of them as a single database, a single table in like a relationship. They usually have rows and columns, but there's no ability to join data across Rose. No ability to really do any of the more complex connectiveness that you get with other data stores what they are connected. Inasmuch as the data in a single blow is connected to each other, you get a little bit more complex. You start getting doc*ment dated. This is this is your mongo DBS, your azure doc*ment, DVDs, couch bases, your couch, TVs, things of that nature.

But what there aren't really great at is being able to connect multiple doc*ments together. While most of them have the ability to potentially join.

This is what probably 95% of the world runs on eyes the relational database paradigm. But the thing I find funny about relational databases, even though it has a relation relations in the name, it's actually pretty poor. It it being able to represent relations in the data.

Well, that's because gra*s are all built on relationships. The essence of a graph from both graph theory and in the graph database world is about relationships and the connectedness of your data. You'll hear me say this many times, but the one kind of major thing that graph database gives you are to know if you want to use a graft database is if if the connections between your data are as important or more important than the data itself. That's a really strong use case for a draft database. So what the graph databases look like? Well, when you start with them, they look like this. They look like any other conceptual data model. You go, Bill. This is actually a conceptual data model for Twitter. You know, you have a user at the center. That tweet has links to it. They have, you know, Hashtags are sources, there's media, and they're all interconnected with one another.\n",

      "zoologist type because the hype is strong with this one. You know, especially if you've been around and heard about graft databases the past few years, Graf databases are the perfect solution to every database problem out there. You should just use them for everything. No, I think we can all imagine. I'll can agree that there isn't one tool to solve every type of problem out there in the world. But that's kind of a graph. Databases have been portrayed as if you would do much research out there, what you'll come across that you'll come across this statement. Everything is a graph. Well, it's probably true. Everything in the world can probably be representative a graft, because everything is really about things and think in connections between things. But what really is missing from this statement when you start talking about it from a technical perspective, is just because it's a graph doesn't mean you should use a graft to solve it. You know, crafts are great for certain problems, and you can use them to solve most problems. But there are usually better technologies for a lot of rope. It's like I said, I work in graft consulting, and I probably most of the time, probably nine times out of 10. I worked with customers to tell them not to use a graft database to solve a problem. It was actually pretty rare. I was at the customer last week and I actually got to tell them to use a graft soldier problem. And it was, Ah, I was kind of a win. It was something that doesn't happen too often.\n",

      "you talk about? Well, we're gonna talk. About what? Graft debate graph Databases are just so everybody has a little bit of a level set. Seems like most people who spit heard of them, which is great. And then why you should care about and why? Why? They're actually useful in some cases and not in others. Then when should use one? Because that's the biggest challenge I see when I work with people is they try to use a graft database for the wrong use case, and it just doesn't end up working. Then you can learn from my mistakes. As I said, I've been doing this. Probably. I've been working draft databases for about four or five years now. I've made a lot of the mistakes that you're gonna make when you start so learned from them. Try not to make. Let's not try not to repeat the same problems I did. And then last, we're gonna talk a little bit about how to make a successful project and and how to actually make that project you're working on successful or to know if it's not gonna be successful early, huh? So what's the gla*s database? Gra*s database the type of no sequel database that's built on top of graph theory. S O graph theory. If you've ever taken a discrete mathematics course, you've probably heard about the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem. Well, what that really comes down to is it comes down a graph theory. Basically, it gives a mathematical construct to how to describe ent*ties in the relationships between them ent*ties. They described it for Texas, which florals vergis ese Texas. It's actually who you ask, and they're represented most frequently by these circles. And edges represent the relationships between Vergis ease and they're represented by the lines. So you'll see that throughout this really what craft databases are all about. They're all they're all about handling highly connected data types. We'll talk about some examples here, coming up, but really they handle this highly connected data types in ways that allow you to get insights into what you're working into your data that you can't get using other technologies. So where do they fit? When I said I'd think about databases, I think about databases is kind of a spectrum of data complexity, irrespective of data complexity from very simple data to very complex data. And there's different databases and data stores out there that do work with each type. Very, very well, simplest. One key value store. We've all probably used a lot of time to use something like this for a cache in a key value store, really.\n",

      "you talk about? Well, we're gonna talk. About what? Graft debate graph Databases are just so everybody has a little bit of a level set. Seems like most people who spit heard of them, which is great. And then why you should care about and why? Why? They're actually useful in some cases and not in others. Then when should use one? Because that's the biggest challenge I see when I work with people is they try to use a graft database for the wrong use case, and it just doesn't end up working. Then you can learn from my mistakes. As I said, I've been doing this. Probably. I've been working draft databases for about four or five years now. I've made a lot of the mistakes that you're gonna make when you start so learned from them. Try not to make. Let's not try not to repeat the same problems I did. And then last, we're gonna talk a little bit about how to make a successful project and and how to actually make that project you're working on successful or to know if it's not gonna be successful early, huh? So what's the gla*s database? Gra*s database the type of no sequel database that's built on top of graph theory. S O graph theory. If you've ever taken a discrete mathematics course, you've probably heard about the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem. Well, what that really comes down to is it comes down a graph theory. Basically, it gives a mathematical construct to how to describe ent*ties in the relationships between them ent*ties. They described it for Texas, which florals vergis ese Texas. It's actually who you ask, and they're represented most frequently by these circles. And edges represent the relationships between Vergis ease and they're represented by the lines. So you'll see that throughout this really what craft databases are all about. They're all they're all about handling highly connected data types. We'll talk about some examples here, coming up, but really they handle this highly connected data types in ways that allow you to get insights into what you're working into your data that you can't get using other technologies. So where do they fit? When I said I'd think about databases, I think about databases is kind of a spectrum of data complexity, irrespective of data complexity from very simple data to very complex data. And there's different databases and data stores out there that do work with each type. Very, very well, simplest. One key value store. We've all probably used a lot of time to use something like this for a cache in a key value store, really.\n",

      "it's it's This is your reaction reticence. Is your Dynamodb? Yes, they're very simple databases. There's a key in a value. There's no real relationships amongst listings. Each one is atomic into itself onto itself. I should say, Get a little bit more. You wanna get a little bit more complex? Say you get wide columns, stores or column oriented databases. This is like Ca*sandra Google Big Table on Apache H Base. If you're familiar with those and these, basically, you really think of them as a single database, a single table in like a relationship. They usually have rows and columns, but there's no ability to join data across Rose. No ability to really do any of the more complex connectiveness that you get with other data stores what they are connected. Inasmuch as the data in a single blow is connected to each other, you get a little bit more complex. You start getting doc*ment dated.

Then we get to await what we've probably Everybody here is probably done. Most of their careers is relation relations, databases, tables, columns, foreign keys. This is what probably 95% of the world runs on eyes the relational database paradigm. But the thing I find funny about relational databases, even though it has a relation relations in the name, it's actually pretty poor. It it being able to represent relations in the data.

      "well, that seems great. It's a pretty weak a*sociation because that relationship can't really add any value to that connection in and of itself. It's a pretty anemic thing because it's just a name you can't add any semantic value. That relationship can't have any connecting this to it, which is why you get down to those sorts of things. You end up with bridge tables in the link tables inside your relational database to really try and represent those sorts of those sorts of rich parts of a relationship that relational databases don't handle. That brings us to graft databases. Graft databases are all about handling the most complex, complex, interconnected data that is, that is, exists out in the thing. Why is that? Well, that's because gra*s are all built on relationships. The essence of a graph from both graph theory and in the graph database world is about relationships and the connectedness of your data. You'll hear me say this many times, but the one kind of major thing that graph database gives you are to know if you want to use a graft database is if if the connections between your data are as important or more important than the data itself. That's a really strong use case for a draft database. So what the graph databases look like? Well, when you start with them, they look like this. They look like any other conceptual data model. You go, Bill. This is actually a conceptual data model for Twitter. You know, you have a user at the center. That tweet has links to it.

You know, especially if you've been around and heard about graft databases the past few years, Graf databases are the perfect solution to every database problem out there. You should just use them for everything. No, I think we can all imagine. I'll can agree that there isn't one tool to solve every type of problem out there in the world. But that's kind of a graph. Databases have been portrayed as if you would do much research out there, what you'll come across that you'll come across this statement. Everything is a graph. Well, it's probably true. Everything in the world can probably be representative a graft, because everything is really about things and think in connections between things. But what really is missing from this statement when you start talking about it from a technical perspective, is just because it's a graph doesn't mean you should use a graft to solve it. You know, crafts are great for certain problems, and you can use them to solve most problems. But there are usually better technologies for a lot of rope. It's like I said, I work in graft consulting, and I probably most of the time, probably nine times out of 10. I worked with customers to tell them not to use a graft database to solve a problem.

      "I would like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity. I just need 30 minutes of your time to explain it, but it has the potential to transform your life. I'm talking about multi level marketing companies, or MLM companies like Mary Kay. Rundown seals at new skin on way and mobilized. They sell different products, but generally a melons have two mainstays in court. First, you don't see them on store shelves. You buy them from distributors like Friends, Family co workers. Secondly, those distributors are always looking for more people to join. And I have a pretty attractive message wire for life because you get to be own boss on extra money back from home. Raise your own children. You can name your own hours to make part time or full time money paying the bills. You're standing with him. People you care about that you love. That's your door that you admire. 20 people, 30 people. Come on. What you waiting for? 100 people share with everybody. They want what we have. We got it. Okay, so I'm supposed to share that with 10 people I love, adore and admire. That's a tough thought. Let's see the judges on this season of Project Runway. That's 30 that's been done. That's obviously four if you count him down twice that size, but I'm still five short and I am out now on. Before he brushed this industry off, you should know collectively, it did around $36 billion in retail sales last year in the U. S. You probably know someone who is considering joining an MLM or who already has on his posting about it 10 times a day on Facebook or instagram on. If you do know someone like that or have considered signing up yourself, this story is important because let me explain how the system is supposed to work. Generally, distributors have two lane ways to make money. Sell the product itself, whether it's a makeup, vitamins or health shakes on own money on those tails on dhe. And this is key. Recruit other people into the company on get money based on their sales on the sales of people they recruit. In turn, just look. \n",

      "when the consequences over this season that die on the condemnation that widespread it feels like it might worth asking what exactly happened? Why did Trump decided to do it? On what, like the ramifications being going for two? Let's start with what happens now. Obviously, the situation in Syria is incredibly complex. You can be forgiven for not fully understanding. What is much less forgivable is pretending to understand when you clearly don't. It's a very, uh, semi complicated, not too complicated if you're smart. But it's a semi complicated problem. Oh, good. It's only semi complicated, is it? I've forgotten. The Trump spent the nineties. The senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies in the Foreign Policy Research Inst*tute. Not as clearly only remembered losing all his dad's money and try unsuccessfully banged Madonna because clearly I'm not smart like him. Look, there are more factions involved here than we have time to come. But the important group to know about about 13 million off in the region spread mostly across Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran. They are the largest ethnic group in the world without a country on their up, so they're right there on minority wherever they live, putting them in a precarious situation. But it's important to know that they have been coast military allies with America in the past, which is why it was so on to hear Trump justify abandoning like this. Somebody wrote in a very, very powerful article today, staging Help us in the Second World War. They didn't help us with Normandy as an example that mentioned names of different battles. They were there, but they're there to help us with their land. And that's a different thing. Let me let me let me get this straight. You want mad because the Kurds didn't help the U. S fight in Normandy. Quick question the f**k does that have to do with anything that there were also no curves at the Battle of Gettysburg or helping us get to the moon?

      "I would like to talk to you about an exciting opportunity. I just need 30 minutes of your time to explain it, but it has the potential to transform your life. I'm talking about multi level marketing companies, or MLM companies like Mary Kay. Rundown seals at new skin on way and mobilized. They sell different products, but generally a melons have two mainstays in court. First, you don't see them on store shelves. You buy them from distributors like Friends, Family co workers. Secondly, those distributors are always looking for more people to join. And I have a pretty attractive message wire for life because you get to be own boss on extra money back from home. Raise your own children. You can name your own hours to make part time or full time money paying the bills. You're standing with him. People you care about that you love. That's your door that you admire. 20 people, 30 people. Come on. What you waiting for? 100 people share with everybody. They want what we have. We got it. Okay, so I'm supposed to share that with 10 people I love, adore and admire. That's a tough thought. Let's see the judges on this season of Project Runway. That's 30 that's been done. That's obviously four if you count him down twice that size, but I'm still five short and I am out now on. Before he brushed this industry off, you should know collectively, it did around $36 billion in retail sales last year in the U. S. You probably know someone who is considering joining an MLM or who already has on his posting about it 10 times a day on Facebook or instagram on. If you do know someone like that or have considered signing up yourself, this story is important because let me explain how the system is supposed to work. Generally, distributors have two lane ways to make money. Sell the product itself, whether it's a makeup, vitamins or health shakes on own money on those tails on dhe. And this is key. Recruit other people into the company on get money based on their sales on the sales of people they recruit. In turn, just look. \n",

If reinforcement learning goes all the way back to a I animal psychology and controls here at the heart of it, it involves a narcotics agent like a person, animal robot or deep net learning to navigate an uncertain environment. But the goal was not devising a new Baruch over what sports are a great example of this. Just think of what our autonomous agent would have to deal with this. You don't have to consider attractions like it serves returns Collins. These actions change the state of the gate. Or, in other words, the current set a leading player. Things like that and every action has performed with a rewarding mine within a point. In order to win the game, set and match our aged needs to follow a policy or a set of rules and strategies in order to maximize flat floor. But if you were building an autonomous agent, how would you actually model this? We know that the agents actions will change the state of the environment so a mother would need to be able to take a studio React. The way this works will be different for every application, and they're probably not surprised to know that building a tennis agent is different from building in Atari. Agent. The researchers at Deepmind use a series of Atari screenshots to build a convolution Alvaro network with a couple of tweaks. The output wasn't a cla*s, but instead it was a target number for the maximum reward. So it was actually dealing with regression, not cla*sifications. They also didn't use.
